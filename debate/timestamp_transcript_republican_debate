IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT

SHOULD IT NOT BE DIVIDED.

277
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,815
YES THERE WERE TWO TIERS, THE

278
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:11,650
SEVEN LOWEST IN THE POLLS.

00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:12,483

IT'S A FLUID PROCESS AND IT WAS

00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:03,688
IMPORTANT IS HAVING A BRAIN.

525
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:07,658

940
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:37,902
EXPANSION BY QUOTING GOD SAYING

941
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:40,404
WHEN THEY ARYE IN HEAVEN ST.

942
00:30:38,35 --> 00:30:41,472
PETER IS NOT GOING TO ASK THEM.

943
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:44,408
WHY SHOULD THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS

944
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:45,676
WHO GENERALLY WANT TO SHRINK

945
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:47,812
GOVERNMENT BELIEVE YOU WON'T USE

946
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,646
YOUR ST. PETER RATIONALE TO

947
00:30:47,945 --> 00:30:52,349
EXPAND EVERY GOVERNMENT PROGRAM.

948
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:54,251
>> FIRST OF ALL, YOU SHOULD KNOW

949
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:56,988
THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN EXPANDED

950
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:58,22
MEDICAID THREE OR FOUR TIMES.

951
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,624
I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING

952
00:30:58,155 --> 00:31:01,626
RESOURCES BACK TO OHIO TO TREAT

953
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:04,328
THE MENTALLY ILL.

954
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,662
10 THOUSAND OF THEM SIT IN OUR

955
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:07,732
PRISONS.

956
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:09,100
IT COSTS $22,000 A YEAR TO KEEP

957
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,133
THEM IN PRISON.

958
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:11,268
I WOULD RATH GET THE THEIR

959
00:31:11,2 --> 00:31:12,903
MEDICATIONS.

960
00:31:11,401 --> 00:31:14,571
SECONDLY WE'RE REHABBING THE

961
00:31:13,37 --> 00:31:16,841
DRUG ADDICTED.

962
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:17,774
80% OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR PRISONS

963
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:20,277
HAVE ADDICTION PROBLEMS.

964
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:21,410
WE TREAT THEM IN THE PRISONS, WE

965
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,847
LEASE THEM IN THE COMMUNITY.

966
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:25,349
AND EVERYBODY ACROSS THIS

967
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,51
COUNTRY KNOWS THAT THE TSUNAMI

968
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:28,653
OF DRUGS IS THREATENING THEIR

969
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:29,887
VERY FAMILIES.

970
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,755
WE'RE TREATING THEM AND GETTING

971
00:31:30,21 --> 00:31:33,190
THEM ON THEIR FEET.

972
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:34,323
AND FINALLY THE WORKING POOR

973
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:36,794
INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM COME INTO

974
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,728
THE EMERGENCY ROOMS WHERE IT

975
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:42,632
COSTS MORE, WHERE THEY'RE SICKER

976
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:42,667
AND WE END UP PAYING, WE BROUGHT

977
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,69
A PROGRAM IN TO MAKE SURE THAT

978
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:47,772
PEOPLE CAN GET ON THEIR FEET.

979
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:48,272
EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO THEIR

980
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,306
GOD GIVEN PURPOSE.

981
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:51,408
TIMELY THE MEDICAID IS GROWING

982
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:56,647
AT ONE OF THE LOWEST RATES IN

983
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:56,680
THE COUNTRY.

984
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:03,553
WE WENT FROM $8 BILLION IN THE

985
00:31:57,514 --> 00:32:03,954
HOLE TO $5 MILLION IN THE BLACK.

986
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,690
[ APPLAUSE ]

987
00:32:04,88 --> 00:32:07,725
>> GENTLEMEN, WE'RE TURNING TO A

988
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,60
NEW SUBJECT THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE

989
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:12,562
BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND SOME OF

990
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:15,66
YOU HAVE BEEN DISAGREING ABOUT

991
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,565
AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF

992
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,301
IMMIGRATION.

993
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,503
GOVERNOR BUSH YOU RELEASED A NEW

994
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:21,605
PLAN THIS WEEK ON ILLEGAL

995
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:22,706
IMMIGRATION FOCUSING ON

996
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,374
ENFORCEMENT WHICH SOME SUGGEST

997
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,442
IS YOUR EFFORT TO SHOW YOU'RE

998
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,977
NOT SOFT ON THAT ISSUE.

999
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,79
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A

1000
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,114
STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE LAST

1001
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,248
YEAR ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

1002
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:33,150
HEAR'S WHAT YOU SAID.

1003
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:35,786
THEY BROKE THE LAW BUT IT'S NOT

1004
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:38,121
A FELONY, IT'S AN ACT OF LOVE,

1005
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,156
IT'S AN ACT OF COMMITMENT TO

1006
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:41,225
YOUR FAMILY.

1007
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:44,328
DO YOU STAND BY THAT STATEME

1008
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:45,863
AND DO YOU STAND BY YOUR SUPPORT

1009
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:47,98
FOR EARNED LEGAL STATUS?

1010
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:47,932
>> I DO.

1011
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,633
I BELIEVE THAT THE GREAT

1012
00:32:48,65 --> 00:32:50,667
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE COMING HERE

1013
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,269
ILLEGALLY HAVE NO OTHER OPTION.

1014
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:52,602
THEY WANT TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR

1015
00:32:52,402 --> 00:32:55,139
FAMILY.

1016
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,973
BUT WE NEED TO CONTROL OUR

1017
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:58,641
BORDER.

1018
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,877
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SPECK

1019
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:02,213
AND CHOOSE WHO COMES IN.

1020
00:33:00,10 --> 00:33:02,246
WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THIS AND

1021
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:05,15
YES THIS WEEK I DID COME UP WITH

1022
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,416
A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY THAT

1023
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,716
MIRRORED WHAT WE SAID IN THE

1024
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:06,751
BOOK.

1025
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:11,122
WHICH IS WE NEED TO DEAL WITH E

1026
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,957
VERIFY, WE NEED TO DEAL WITH

1027
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:16,60
PEOPLE THAT COME WITH A LEGAL

1028
00:33:13,90 --> 00:33:17,928
VISA AND OVERSTAY, WE NEED TO BE

1029
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:20,764
STRATEGIC ON HOW WE DEAL WITH

1030
00:33:18,62 --> 00:33:21,665
BORDER SECURITY, WE NEED TO

1031
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,698
ELIMINATE THE SANCTUARY CITIES

1032
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:24,468
 THIS COUNTRY.

1033
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:26,203
IT IS RIDICULOUS AND TRAGIC THAT

1034
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:27,437
PEOPLE ARE DYING BECAUSE OF THE

1035
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:29,373
FACT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

1036
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:30,439
NOT FOLLOWING THIS FEDERAL LAW.

1037
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:32,42
THERE'S MUCH TO DO.

1038
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:33,710
AND I THINK RATHER THAN TALKING

1039
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,412
ABOUT THIS AS A WEDGE ISSUE

1040
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:37,314
WHICH BARACK OBAMA HAS DONE NOW

1041
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:39,784
FOR SIX LONG YEARS, THE NEXT

1042
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:40,583
PRESIDENT, AND I HOPE TO BE THAT

1043
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:44,353
PRESIDENT, WILL FIX THIS ONCE

1044
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:45,722
AND FORALL SO THAT WE CAN TURN

1045
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:47,792
THIS INTO A DRIVER FOR HIGH

1046
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:49,359
SUSTAINED LEGAL GROWTH.

1047
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:52,29
AND THAT SHOULD BE A PATH TO

1048
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:52,797
EARN LEGAL STATUS.

1049
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:57,1
NOTAMNESTY.

1050
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:58,969
EARN LEGAL STATUS.

1051
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:01,5
>> THANK YOU, SIR.

1052
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:02,973
MR. TRUMP IT HAS NOT ESCAPED

1053
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:05,42
ANYBODY'S NOTICE THAT YOU SAY

1054
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:08,612
THAT THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, THE

1055
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:10,681
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS SENDING

1056
00:34:08,745 --> 00:34:12,116
CRIMINALS, RAPISTS, DRUG DEALERS

1057
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:15,652
ACROSS THE BORDER.

1058
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:16,687
GOVERNOR BUSH CALLED THOSE

1059
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:16,987
REMARKS QUOTE EXTRAORDINARILY

1060
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,123
UGLY.

1061
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,58
I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL US, TALK TO

1062
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:25,94
HIM DIRECTLY AND SAY HOW YOU

1063
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:26,730
RESPOND TO THAT, AND YOU HAVE

1064
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:28,131
REPEATEDLY SAID THAT YOU HAVE

1065
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:31,1
EVIDENCE THAT THE MEXICAN

1066
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:32,536
GOVERNMENT IS DOING THIS BUT

1067
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:34,471
THAT YOU HAVE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE

1068
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:36,873
REFUSED OR DECLINED TO SHARE.

1069
00:34:34,603 --> 00:34:37,607
WHY NOT USE THIS FIRST

1070
00:34:37,7 --> 00:34:38,876
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

1071
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:39,376
TO SHARE YOUR PROOF WITH THE

1072
00:34:39,9 --> 00:34:42,880
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1073
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:44,815
>> SO, IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME, YOU

1074
00:34:43,13 --> 00:34:44,848
WOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING ABOUT

1075
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,985
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, CHRIS.

1076
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,553
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING

1077
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:52,422
ABOUT IT.

1078
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:54,24
THIS WAS NOT A SUBJECT THAT WAS

1079
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:56,693
ON ANYBODY'S MIND UNTIL I

1080
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,127
BRGHT IT UP AT ANY

1081
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:59,463
ANNOUNCEMENT.

1082
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,732
AND I SAID MEXICO IS SENDING.

1083
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:03,567
EXPECT THE REPORTERS, BECAUSE

1084
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,336
THEY'RE A VERY DISHONEST LOT

1085
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,368
GENERALLY SPEAK IN THE WORLD OF

1086
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:09,39
POLITICS, THEY DIDN'T COVER MY

1087
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:11,608
STATEMENT THE WAY I SAID IT.

1088
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:14,111
THE FACT IS SINCE THEN MANY

1089
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:16,80
KILLINGS, MURDERS, CRIME, DRUGS

1090
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,381
POURING ACROSS THE BORDE ARE

1091
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:17,882
MONEY GOING OUT AND THE DRUGS

1092
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:21,318
COMING IN.

1093
00:35:18,15 --> 00:35:24,20
AND I SAID WE NEED TO BUILD A

1094
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:24,355
WALL, AND IT HAS TO BE BUILT

1095
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:24,388
QUICKLY.

1096
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:27,790
AND I DON'T MIND HAVING A BIG

1097
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,194
BEAUTIFUL DOOR IN THAT WALL SO

1098
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:32,863
THAT PEOPLE CAN COME INTO THIS

1099
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:32,897
COUNTRY LEGALLY.

1100
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:40,803
BUT WE NEED JEB TO BUILD A WALL,

1101
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:43,941
WE NEED TO KEEP ILLEGALS OUT.

1102
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:45,776
>> MR. TRUMP, I'LL GIVE YOU 30

1103
00:35:44,74 --> 00:35:47,244
SECONDS, I'LL GIVE YOU 30

1104
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,247
SECONDS TO ANSWER MY QUESTION,

1105
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:52,516
WHICH WAS, WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU

1106
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,817
HAVE, SPECIFIC EVIDENCE THAT THE

1107
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:56,86
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS SENDING

1108
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,787
CRIMINALS ACROSS THE BORDER?

1109
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,522
30 SECONDS.

1110
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:00,689
>> BORDER PATROL, I WAS AT THE

1111
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:01,892
BORDER LAST WEEK.

1112
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:01,926
BORDER PATROL, PEOPLE THAT I

1113
00:36:02,26 --> 00:36:05,729
DEAL WITH, THAT I TALK TO, THEY

1114
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:07,131
SAY THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1115
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:09,733
BECAUSE OUR LEADERS ARE STUPID.

1116
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:11,468
OUR POLITICIANS ARE STUPID.

1117
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:15,372
AND THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS

1118
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:16,140
MUCH SMARTER, MUCH SHARPER, MUCH

1119
00:36:15,505 --> 00:36:17,374
MORE CUNNING AND THEY SEND THE

1120
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:18,375
BAD ONES OVER BECAUSE THEY DON'T

1121
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:20,811
WANT TO PAY FOR THEM.

1122
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:21,111
THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE CARE OF

THEM.

1124
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,314
WHY SHOULD THEY WHEN THE STUPID

LEADERS OF THE UNITED STATES

1126
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,83
WILL DO IT FOR THEM.

1127
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:30,654
THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING WHETHER

OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT MORE TO

00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:39,729

GOVERNOR KASICH I KNOW YOU DON'T

1156
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,201
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.

1157
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:22,372
BUT I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT

1158
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:24,542
THE MERIT OF WHAT HE JUST SAID.

1159
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,607
WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE AMERICAN

1160
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:29,46
GOVERNMENT IS STUPID, THAT THE

1161
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:31,749
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS SENDING

1162
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:33,851
CRIMINALS, THAT WE'RE BEING

1163
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,118
BAMBOOZLED, IS THAT AN ADEQUATE

1164
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:36,487
RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION OF

1165
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:38,322
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

1166
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,458
>> I WAS JUST SAYING TO CHRIS

1167
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:42,25
CHRISTIE, THEY SAY WE'RE

1168
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,562
OUTSPOKEN, WE NEED TO TAKE

1169
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,229
LESSONS FROM DONALD TRUMP IF

1170
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,465
WE'RE REALLY GOING TO LEARN IT.

1171
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:48,332
DONALD TRUMP IS HITTING A NERVE

1172
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,366
IN THIS COUNTRY.

1173
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,468
HE IS.

1174
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,470
HE'S HITTING A NERVE.

1175
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,704
PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED.

1176
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,638
THEY'RE FED UP.

1177
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,873
THEY DON'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT

1178
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,575
IS WORKING FOR THEM.

1179
00:37:56,6 --> 00:37:59,308
FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TUNE HIM

1180
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,578
OUT, THEY'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

1181
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,481
HE'S GOT HIS SOLUTIONS.

1182
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:06,484
SOME OF US HAVE OTHER SOLUTIONS.

1183
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:08,752
LOOK, I BALANCED THE FEDERAL

1184
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,954
BUDGET WHEN I WAS IN WASHINGTON.

1185
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,987
HASN'T BEEN DONE SINCE.

1186
00:38:10,87 --> 00:38:13,657
I WAS A MILITARY REFORMER.

1187
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:16,359
I TOOK THE STATE OF OHIO FROM AN

1188
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:23,901
$8 BILLION HOLE IN A $350,000

1189
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:26,470
JOB LOSS TO A $2 BILLION SURPLUS

1190
00:38:24,34 --> 00:38:26,504
AND A GAIN OF 350,000 JOBS

1191
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,471
RESPECTFULLY CAN WE TALK

1192
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:27,505
ABOUT --

1193
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,539
>> THE POINT IS WE ALL HAVE

1194
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:29,439
SOLUTIONS.

1195
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:30,875
MR. TRUMP IS TOUCHING A NERVE

1196
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,642
BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT THE WALL TO

1197
00:38:31,8 --> 00:38:33,343
BE BUILT.

1198
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:34,111
THEY WANT TO SEE AN END TO

1199
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,245
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

1200
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:36,647
WE CALL DO.

1201
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,581
BUT WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS

1202
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,916
OF GETTING THERE AND YOU'RE

1203
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:41,485
GOING TO HEAR FROM ALL OF US

1204
00:38:39,49 --> 00:38:41,519
TONIGHT ABOUT WHAT OUR IDEAS

1205
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,387
ARE.

1206
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:45,422
>> SENATOR RUBIO, LET ME SEE IF

1207
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:49,292
I CAN DO BETTER WITH YOU.

1208
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:50,961
IS IT AS SIMPLE AS OUR LEADERS

1209
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:53,831
ARE STUPID, THEIR LEADERS ARE

1210
00:38:51,94 --> 00:38:55,465
SMART AND ALL OF THE ILLEGALS

1211
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,500
COMING OVER ARE CRIMINALS?

1212
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,534
>> THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THAT

1213
00:38:56,634 --> 00:39:02,172
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE COMING

1214
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:02,506
ACROSS THE BORDER ARE NOT FROM

1215
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:02,540
MEXICO.

1216
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,776
THEY'RE COMING FROM GUATEMALA,

1217
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,811
HONDURAS.

1218
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:12,917
I ALSO BELIEVE WE NEED A FENCE.

1219
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:14,552
THE PROBLEM IS IF EL CHAPO

1220
00:39:13,50 --> 00:39:17,287
BUILDS A TURNL UNDER THE FENCE,

1221
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:19,890
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT TOO.

1222
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:20,957
BUT I AGREE WITH GOVERNOR KASICH

1223
00:39:20,24 --> 00:39:22,426
JUST SAID.

1224
00:39:21,91 --> 00:39:24,327
PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED.

1225
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,863
THIS IS THE MOST GENEROUS

1226
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:26,863
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHEN I

1227
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,432
COMES TO IMMIGRATION.

1228
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:30,399
THERE ARE A MILLION PEOPLE A

1229
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,500
YEAR WHO ILLEGALLY IMMIGRATE TO

1230
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,805

1232
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:35,772

1233
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:37,107
DESPITE OR GENEROSITY WE'RE

1234
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,409

THEYE WONDERING IF THEY SHOULD

1242
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:53,190
COME IN ILLEGALLY.

1243
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:54,992
IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT

1244
00:39:53,323 --> 00:39:56,60
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED OTHERWISE

1245
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,93
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP TALKING

1246
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,930
ABOUT THIS FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS

1247
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,230
LIKE WE HAVE FOR THE LAST 30

1248
00:40:00,64 --> 00:40:03,600

COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,443
REFORM, INCLUDING A PATH TO

1254
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,313
CITIZENSHIP.

1255
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,615
NOW YOU SAY THAT WAS A QUICK

1256
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:18,882
REACTION TO SOMETHING YOU HADN'T

1257
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:21,318
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT AND THAT

1258
00:40:19,16 --> 00:40:22,419
YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND.

1259
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:23,587
OTHER THAN POLITICS, COULD YOU

1260
00:40:22,552 --> 00:40:23,621
EXPLAIN WHY IN THE LAST TWO

1261
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:28,592
YEARS YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR

00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:28,626
POSITION ON A PATH TO

1263
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:34,431
CITIZENSHIP AND ARE THERE OTHER

1264
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:34,932
PAST POSITIONS WE SHOULDN'T HOLD

1265
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:36,634
YOU TO?

1266
00:40:35,65 --> 00:40:38,301
>> I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT.

1267
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,636
I LISTENED TO THE AMERICAN

1268
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,603
PEOPLE.

1269
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,636
PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA WANT A

1270
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,39

AND OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS.

1274
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,46
I LOOK AT HOW THIS PRESIDENT

1275
00:40:48,45 --> 00:40:50,80
MESSED UP THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM

1276
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:52,215
IN THIS COUNTRY.

1277
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:53,150
MOST IMPORTANTLY I LISTENED TO

1278
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,152
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1279
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:56,886
I'VE BEEN TO THE BORDER WITH

THERE.

1283
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,826
THERE ARE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS

1284
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:04,427
PENETRATING OUR SOUTHERN

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,195
BORDERS, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

1286
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:07,865

SECURE THE BOARD ARE, NO AMNESTY

AMNESTY THAT GIVES PRIORITY TO

00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,7
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WAGES.

1291
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,776
>> SENATOR CRUZ, SOME 1400

00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:55,45
AND NOT ONLY WILL I SUPPORT IT,

1307
00:41:53,77 --> 00:41:55,913
I HAVE AUTHORED KATE'S LAW IN

1308
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,847
THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND

1309
00:41:56,46 --> 00:41:59,249
FILED THAT LEGISLATION.

1310
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,51
I TRIED TO GET THE SENATE TO

1311
00:41:59,382 --> 00:42:02,352
VOTE TO PASS KATE'S LAW ON THE

1312
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,921
FLOOR OF THE SENATE JUST ONE

1313
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:07,591
WEEK AGO AND THE LEADER OF OUR

1314
00:42:04,54 --> 00:42:08,225
OWN PARTY BLOCKED A VOTE ON

1315
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:11,60
KATE'S LAW.

1316
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:11,829
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS REFERENCE

1317
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,162
MADE TO OUR LEADERS BEING

1318
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,864
STUPID.

1319
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:14,732
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF

1320
00:42:13,997 --> 00:42:17,334
STUPIDITY.

1321
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:19,336
IT'S THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO

1322
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:21,404
ENFORCE THE IMMIGRATION LAWS.

1323
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:22,840
THAT THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY IN

1324
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:24,374
THE WASHINGTON CARTEL THAT

1325
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,176
SUPPORT AMNESTY.

1326
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:27,577
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TALKED ABOUT

1327
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:28,411
FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMING THIS

1328
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,846
COUNTRY.

1329
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:31,681
THERE'S 7 BILLION PEOPLE ACROSS

1330
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,350
THE FACE OF THE GLOBE, MANY OF

1331
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,683
WHOM WANT TO COME TO THIS

1332
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:35,485
COUNTRY.

1333
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:37,287
IF THEY COME LEGALLY, GREAT.

1334
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:42,25
BUT IF THEY COME ILLEGALLY AND

1335
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,659
THEY GET AMNESTY, THAT IS HOW WE

1336
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,894
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THIS

1337
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,261
COUNTRY AND IT REALLY IS

1338
00:42:44,27 --> 00:42:45,896
STRIKING.

1339
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:47,830
A MAJORITY OF THE CANDIDATES ON

1340
00:42:46,29 --> 00:42:50,801
THIS STAGE SUPPORTED AMNESTY.

1341
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:56,506
I'VE NEVER SUPPORTED AMNESTY AND

1342
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:58,75
I LED THE FIGHT AGAINST CHUCK

1343
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,877
SCHUMER'S FIGHT AGAINST AMNESTY.

1344
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,779
>> WE'RE GOING TO SWITCH TOPICS

1345
00:43:00,10 --> 00:43:03,680
AND TALK A BIT ABOUT TERROR AND

1346
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:07,517
NATIONAL SECURITY.

1347
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:08,252
GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, YOU'VE SAID

1348
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:08,285
THAT SENATOR PAUL'S OPPOSITION

1349
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:11,688
TO THE PHONE RECORDS MADE THE

1350
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,323
UNITED STATES WEAKER AND MORE

1351
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,992
VULNERABLE, EVEN GOING SO FAR TO

1352
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:16,794
SAY HE SHOULD BE CALL BEFORE

1353
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:18,28
CONGRESS TO ANSWER FOR IT IF WE

1354
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,728
SHOULD BE HIT BY ANOTHER

1355
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:22,399
TERRORIST ATTACK.

1356
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:24,902
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE YOU CAN

1357
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:25,936
ASSIGN BLAME TO SENATOR PAUL FOR

1358
00:43:25,35 --> 00:43:27,171
OPPOSING THE BULK COLLECTION OF

1359
00:43:26,69 --> 00:43:28,638
PEOPLE'S PHONE RECORDS IN THE

1360
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,739
EVENT OF A TERRORIST ATTACK?

1361
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,640
>> YES, I DO.

1362
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,741
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

1363
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:34,243
I'M THE ONLY PERSON ON THIS

1364
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:36,780
STAGE WHO'S ACTUALLY FILED

1365
00:43:34,377 --> 00:43:36,814
APPLICATIONS UNDER THE PATRIOT

1366
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:40,417
ACT, WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE THE

1367
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:42,652
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

1368
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,653
COURT, WHO HAS PROSECUTED AND

1369
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,922
INVESTIGATED AND JAILED

1370
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,256
TERRORISTS IN THE COUNTRY AFTER

1371
00:43:45,55 --> 00:43:48,826
SEPTEMBER 11th.

1372
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:50,60
WAS APPOINTED U.S. ATTORNEY BY

1373
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,94
PRESIDENT BUSH ON SEPTEMBER

1374
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,629
10th, 2001.

1375
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,997
AND THE WORLD CHANGED ENORMOUSLY

1376
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:55,32
THE NEXT DAY AND IT HAPPENED IN

1377
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,399
MY STATE.

1378
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,35
THIS IS NOT THEORETICAL TO ME.

1379
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:02,105
I WENT TO THE FUNERALS.

1380
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:02,539
WE LOST FRIENDS OF OURS IN THE

1381
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,473
TRADE CENTER.

1382
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:05,275
MY OWN WIFE WAS TWO BLOCKS FROM

1383
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:07,144
THE TRADE CENTER AT HER OFFICE.

1384
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:08,578
WHEN YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE

1385
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:10,714
FOR DOING THIS, YOU CAN DO IT

1386
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:13,283
AND WE DID IT FOR SEVEN YEARS IN

1387
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:14,718
ANY OFFICE, RESPECTING CIVIL

1388
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,85
LIBERTIES AND PROTECTING THE

1389
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,687
HOMELAND.

1390
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:19,189
AND I WILL MAKE NO APOMGS EVER

1391
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,357
FOR PROTECTING THE LIVES AND THE

1392
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,491
SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1393
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:24,828
WE HAVE TO GIVE MORE TOOLS TO

1394
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,862
OUR FOLK TO DO THIS AND THEN

1395
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,998
TRUST THOSE PEOPLE AND OVERSEE

1396
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,735
THEM TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY.

1397
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:32,134
AS PRESIDENT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

1398
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,137
I WILL DO.

1399
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:36,406
>> MEGYN, MAY I RESPOND?

1400
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:38,575
>> GO AHEAD, SIR.

1401
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:41,311
>> I WANT TO COLLECT MORE

1402
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:44,781
RECORDS FROM TERRORISTS BUT LESS

1403
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:47,84
RECORDS FROM INNOCENT AMERICANS.

1404
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:48,451
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT WAS WHAT WE

1405
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:51,154
FOUGHT THE REVOLUTION OVER.

1406
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:53,490
JOHN ADAMS SAID IT WAS A SPARK

1407
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,924
THAT LED TO OUR WAR FOR

1408
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:55,58
INDEPENDENCE.

1409
00:44:54,57 --> 00:44:56,558
AND I'M PROUD OF STANDING FOR

1410
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,928
THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND I WILL

1411
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,562
CONTINUE TO STAND FOR THE BILL

1412
00:44:58,61 --> 00:45:03,233
OF RIGHTS.

1413
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:05,168
>> AND MEGYN, THAT'S A

1414
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,536
COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS ANSWER.

1415
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,838
I WANT TO COLLECT MORE RECORDS

1416
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:09,606
FROM TERRORISTS BUT LESS RECORDS

1417
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:12,75
FROM OTHER PEOPLE.

1418
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:12,409
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO KNOW,

1419
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,676
MEGYN.

1420
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:14,744
>> YOU SUPPORT THE AMENDMENT.

1421
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,46
>> I TELL YOU --

1422
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:21,285
>> GET A WARRANT.

1423
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:22,519
GET A JUDGE TO SIGN A WARRANT.

1424
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,253
>> SENATOR --

1425
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:23,586
>> GOVERNOR CHRISTIE MAKE YOUR

1426
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,55
POINT.

1427
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,856
>> WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN A

1428
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:28,158
SUBCOMMITTEE BLOWING HOT AIR

1429
00:45:27,24 --> 00:45:28,625
ABT THAT YOU CAN SAY THINGS

1430
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,927
LIKE THAT.

1431
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:30,859
WHEN YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR

1432
00:45:30,60 --> 00:45:31,995
PROTECTING THE LIVES OF THE

1433
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:34,731
AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEN YOU NEED

1434
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:40,2
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE --

1435
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:42,672
>> HERE THE PROBLEM, GOVERNOR.

1436
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:44,74
YOU FUND MENDTE TALLY

1437
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,408
MISUNDERSTOOD THE BILL OF

1438
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:44,441
RIGHTS.

1439
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,943
I'M TALKING ABOUT SEARCHES

1440
00:45:46,43 --> 00:45:47,945
WITHOUT WARRANTS.

1441
00:45:48,45 --> 00:45:49,846
>> THERE IS NO --

1442
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:52,215
>> -- ALL OF AMERICAN'S RECORDS

1443
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,950
AND THAT'S WHAT I FOUGHT TO END.

1444
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,450
I DON'T TRUST PRESIDENT OBAMA

1445
00:45:53,83 --> 00:45:55,152
WITH OUR RECORDS.

1446
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:56,886
I KNOW YOU GAVE HIM A BIG HUG

1447
00:45:55,285 --> 00:46:02,158
AND IF YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM A

1448
00:45:57,20 --> 00:46:04,94
BIG HUG AGAIN, GO RIGHT AHEAD.

1449
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:07,96
>> GO AHEAD, GOVERNOR.

1450
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:08,598
>> AND YOU KNOW, SENATOR PAUL,

1451
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,699
SENATOR PAUL, YOU KNOW THE HUGS

1452
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:11,534
THAT I REMEMBER ARE THE HUGS

1453
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,702
THAT I GAVE TO THE FAMILIES WHO

1454
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,36
LOST THEIR PEOPLE ON SEPTEMBER

1455
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,770
11th.

1456
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,273
THOSE ARE THE HUGS I REMEMBER

1457
00:46:14,904 --> 00:46:17,841
AND THOSE HAD NOTHING TO DO --

1458
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,642
AND THOSE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

1459
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:22,544
POLITICS UNLIKE WHAT YOU'RE

1460
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:23,613
DOING BY CUTTING SPEECHES ON THE

1461
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,315
FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND PUTTING

1462
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:27,184
THEM ON THE INTERNET WITHIN HALF

1463
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,285
AN HOUR TO RAISE MONEY FOR YOUR

1464
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,986
CAMPAIGN AND PUTTING OUR COUNTRY

1465
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,687
AT RISK.

1466
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,888
>> WE HAVE TO CUT IT OFF THERE.

1467
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,255
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING

1468
00:46:32,22 --> 00:46:32,856
EXCHANGE.

1469
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,657
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

1470
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,861
I WANT TO MOVE ON BECAUSE --

1471
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:40,697
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO YOU BUT I

1472
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,897
REALLY WANT TO GET TO A FACEBOOK

1473
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,433
QUESTIONER.

1474
00:46:42,32 --> 00:46:48,205
ALEX HAS THE FOLLOWING QUESTION.

1475
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:50,340
>> MY QUESTION IS, HOW WOULD THE

1476
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,541
CANDIDATES STOP THE ACTIONS OF

1477
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,44
ISIS AND STRONG INFLUENCE IN THE

1478
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:54,411
U.S. IF THEY WERE TO BECOME

1479
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:55,512
PRESIDENT.

1480
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:56,846
>> SENATOR CRUZ, I WANT TO TALK

1481
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:59,816
TO YOU ABOUT THIS BECAUSE MANY

1482
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,518
OF THE FACEBOOK USE ESHS AND THE

1483
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:03,86
FOLKS ON FACEBOOK WANTED THE

1484
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:03,419
CANDIDATES TO SPEAK TO ISIS

1485
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,55
TONIGHT.

1486
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:06,723
YOU ASKED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

1487
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:08,424
JOINT CHIEFS A QUESTION.

1488
00:47:06,856 --> 00:47:09,426
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO DESTROY

1489
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:13,63
ISIS IN 90 DAYS.

1490
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:15,198
HE TOLD YOU THAT ISIS WOULD

1491
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:18,634
TRULY BE DESTROYED ONCE THEY'RE

1492
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:19,2
IN THE POPULATIONS OF WHERE THEY

1493
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:21,104
RESIDE.

1494
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,404
HOW WOULD YOU DESTROY ISIS IN 90

1495
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,373
DAYS?

1496
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:26,9
>> MEGYN, WE NEED A COMMANDER IN

1497
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,43
CHIEF THAT SPEAKS THE TRUTH.

1498
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,545
WE WILL NOT DEFEAT RADICAL

1499
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:33,16
ISLAMIC TERRORISM SO LONG AS WE

1500
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,50
HAVE A PRESIDENT UNWILLING TO

1501
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:41,658
UTTER THE WORDS "RADICAL ISLAMIC

1502
00:47:40,623 --> 00:47:42,59
TERRORISM."

[ APPLAUSE ]

1504
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,795
WHEN I ASKED GENERAL DEMPSEY,

1505
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,396
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS

1506
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,997
WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED

1507
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,433
MILITARILY TO DESTROY ISIS, HE

1508
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,799
SAID THERE IS NO MILITARY

1509
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,768
SOLUTION.

1510
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:53,703
WE NEED TO CHANGE THE CONDITIONS

1511
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:56,906
ON THE GROUND SO THAT YOUNG MEN

1512
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:58,640
ARE NOT IN POVERTY AND

1513
00:47:57,40 --> 00:48:00,777
SUSCEPTIBLE TO RADICALIZATION.

1514
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,244
THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IS

1515
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,645
NONSENSE.

1516
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,813
IT'S THE SAME ANSWER THE STATE

1517
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,548
DEPARTMENT GAVE THAT WE NEED TO

1518
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:04,581
GIVE THEM JOBS.

1519
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,84
WHAT WE NEED IS A COMMANDER IN

1520
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:13,290
CHIEF WHO MAKES CLEAR IF YOU

1521
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:14,757
JOIN ISIS, IF YOU WAGE JIHAD ON

1522
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,292
AMERICA, THEN YOU ARE SIGNING

1523
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:19,28
YOUR DEATH WARRANT.

1524
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:25,102
>> YOU DON'T SEE IT AS AN I'D

1525
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:25,768
LOGICAL PROBLEM.

1526
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,838
>> OF COURSE IT IS.

1527
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:30,807
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I

1528
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:33,676
INTRODUCED THE EX-PATRIOT

1529
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,445
TERRORIST ACT IN THE SENATE THAT

1530
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:39,716
SAID IF ANY AMERICAN TRAVELS TO

1531
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,683
THE MIDDLE EAST AND JOINS ISIS,

1532
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:41,918
HE OR SHE FORFEITS THEIR

1533
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:44,954
CITIZENSHIP SO THEY DON'T USE A

1534
00:48:42,51 --> 00:48:46,223
PASSPORT TO COME BACK AND WAGE

1535
00:48:45,88 --> 00:48:47,824
JIHAD ON AMERICA.

1536
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:50,960
LET ME CONTRAST PRESIDENT OBAMA

1537
00:48:47,957 --> 00:48:52,761
WHO AT THE PRAYER BREAKFAST

1538
00:48:51,94 --> 00:48:53,130
ESSENTIALLY ACTED AS AN

1539
00:48:52,895 --> 00:48:55,298
APOLOGIST.

1540
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,732
HE SAID GOSH, THE CREW SAID, THE

1541
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,200
ACQUISITIONS.

1542
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:59,435
WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT SHOWS

1543
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:01,738
THE COURAGE THAT EGYPT'S

1544
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:04,641
PRESIDENT DID, A MUSLIM WHEN HE

1545
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:05,808
CALLED OUT THE RADICAL U ISLAMIC

1546
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:07,511
TERRORISTS WHO ARE THREATENING

1547
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:09,946
THE WORLD.

FOR DAYS ON END IN THIS CAME

1551
00:49:12,48 --> 00:49:16,685
PAIN YOU STRUGGLED TO ANSWER A

1552
00:49:14,50 --> 00:49:18,555
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER KNOWING

1553
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:20,357
WHAT WE KNOW NOW --

1554
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:20,690

>> I REMEMBER IT TOO.

00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:24,461
AND ISIS OF COURSE IS NOW

1558
00:49:23,993 --> 00:49:25,862
THRIVING THERE.

1559
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,730
YOU FINALLY SAID NO.

1560

TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO

1561
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:31,468
DIED IN THAT WAR WHO SAY THEY

1562
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,270
LIBERATED A COUNTRY OPEN DOSED

1563
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,971
A RUTHLESS DICTATOR, HOW DO YOU

1564
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,372
LOOK AT THEM NOW AND SAY YOUR

1565
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:38,741
BROTHER'S WAR WAS A MISTAKE?

HAVING SECURITY BE THE FST

1569

00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,848
A MISTAKE.

I WOULDN'T HAVE GONE IN.

00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:49,653
HOWEVER, FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DID

1573
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:49,686
LOSE THEIR LIVES AND THE

1574
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,855
FAMILIES THAT SUFFERED BECAUSE

1575
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,156
OF IT, I KNOW THIS FULL WELL.

1576
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,191
BECAUSE AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE

1577
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:57,661
OF FLORIDA, I CALLED EVERY ON

1578
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,694
OF THEM, UNONE OF THEM THAT I

1579
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,196
COULD FIND THE TELL THEM I WAS

1581
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,432
ABOUT THEM.

1582
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:05,669
IT WAS REALLY HARD TO DO.

1583
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,702
AND EVERY ONE OF THEM SAID THAT

1584
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:10,507
THEIR CHILD DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.

1585
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,942
AND WHILE IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR

1586
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,511
THE TO DO, IT WAS BASED ON THAT.

1587
00:50:13,76 --> 00:50:16,979
HERE'S THE LESSON THAT WE SHOULD

1588
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,780
TAKE FROM THIS.

1589
00:50:17,113 --> 00:50:19,549
BARACK OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT

1590
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,650
AND HE ABANDONED IRAQ.

1591
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,919
HE PLEFT.

1592
00:50:20,783 --> 00:50:26,256
AND WHEN HE LEFT AL QAEDA WAS

1593
00:50:23,52 --> 00:50:27,23
DONE FOR, ISIS WAS SKREE YATED

1594
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:27,557
BECAUSE OF THE VOID THAT WE

1595
00:50:27,156 --> 00:50:29,726
LEFT.

1596
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:32,662
AND THE VOID NOW EXISTS AS A

1597
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:33,796
CALIPHATE THE SIZE OF INDIANA.

1598
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:35,665
TO HONOR THE PEOPLE THAT DIED,

1599
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:38,801
WE NEED TO STOP THE IRAN

1600
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:40,169
AGREEMENT FOR SURE BECAUSE THE

1601
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:41,538
IRANIANS HAVE THEIR BLOOD ON

1602
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,772
THEIR HANDS AND WE NEED TO TAKE

1603
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,140
OUT ISIS WITH EVERY TOOL AT OUR

1604
00:50:43,906 --> 00:50:46,142

1606
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:50,614

PARTNERS IN THE ARAB WORLD.

1608
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,749
WHICH ARAB COUNTRY NOT ALREADY

1609
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:56,986
IN THE U.S. LED COALITION HAS

1610
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:57,320
THE POTENTIAL TO BE OUR GREATEST

1611
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,322
PARTNER?

1613
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,659
WE HAVE.

1614
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:04,60
YOU LOOK AT EGYPT, PROBABLY THE

1615
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:05,629
BEST RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD IN

1616
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:08,732
ISRAEL AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME.

1617
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:08,765
YOU LOOK AT THE SAUDI EFFECT

1618
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:13,136
EARLIER THIS YEAR, I MET WITH

1619
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,770
SAUDI LEADERS AND I ASKED THEM

1620
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,72
WHAT'S THE GREATEST CHALLENGE IN

1621
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:17,940
THE WORLD TODAY.

1622
00:51:16,205 --> 00:51:20,42
THEY SAID THE DISENGAGEMENT OF

1623
00:51:18,74 --> 00:51:20,777
AMERICA.

1624
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:24,447
WE'RE LEADING FROM BEHIND UNDER

1625
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:25,281
THE OBAMA-CLINTON DOCTRINE.

1626
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,783
WE NEED TO STAND UP AND START

1627
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:29,286
LEADING AGAIN AND WE WOULD HAVE

1628
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:31,521
ALLIES IN ISRAEL AND THROUGHOUT

1629
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:34,257
THE PERSIAN GULF.

1630

>> DR. CARSON, PRESIDENT OBAMA

1631
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,927

BANNING ENHANCED INTERROGATION

1633
00:51:38,60 --> 00:51:41,364
TECHNIQUES IN FIGHTING TERROR.

1634
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,399
AS PRESIDENT WOULD YOU BRING

1635
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,733
BACK WATER BOARDING?

1636
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:45,669
>> THANK YOU MEGYN, I WASN'T

1637
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:46,2

1638
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,471
AGAIN.

1639
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:49,572

DON'T WORRY.

1641

YOU MAY RUE THAT REQUEST.

1642
00:51:53,75 --> 00:51:56,513
>> ALLRIGHT.

1643
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:59,248
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE DO IN ORDER TO

GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED

1645
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:02,285
IS OUR BUSINESS.

1646
00:52:00,216 --> 00:52:02,319
AND I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE

1647
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:07,957
BROADCASTING TO EVERYBODY WHAT

1648
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:12,829
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

1649
00:52:08,90 --> 00:52:13,896
YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOTTEN INTO THIS

1650
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:14,764
MIND-SET OF FIGHTING POLITICALLY

1651
00:52:14,30 --> 00:52:20,303
CORRECT WARS.

1652
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:20,337
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A

1653
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:24,240
POLITICALLY CORRECT WAR.

1654
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:26,75
AND THE LEFT, OF COURSE, WILL

1655
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:28,410
SAY CARSON DOESN'T BELIEVE IN

1656
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:29,712
THE GENEVA CONVENTION.

1657
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,47
CARSON DOESN'T BELIEVE IN

1658
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,749
FIGHTING STUPID WARS.

1659
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,984
WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS WE

1660
00:52:32,882 --> 00:52:35,918
ARE WANT TO UTILIZE THE

1661
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:38,988
TREMENDOUS INTELLECT THAT WE

1662
00:52:36,52 --> 00:52:39,288
HAVE IN THE MILITARY TO WIN

1663
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:40,457
WARS.

1664
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:43,25
AND I HAVE TALKED TO A LOT OF

1665
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:44,494
THE GENERALS, A LOT OF OUR

1666
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,229
ADVANCED PEOPLE, AND BELIEVE ME,

1667
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:47,564
IF WE GAVE THEM THE MISSION,

1668
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,865
WHICH IS WHAT THE COMMANDER IN

1669
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,166
CHIEF DOES, THEY WOULD BE ABLE

1670
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:51,801
TO CARRY IT OUT.

1671
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:53,403
AND IF WE DON'T TIE THEIR HANDS

1672
00:52:51,934 --> 00:52:57,674
BEHIND THEIR BACK, THEY WILL DO

1673
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:58,74
IT EXTREMELY EFFECTIVELY.

1674
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:00,776
[ APPLAUSE ]

1675
00:52:58,207 --> 00:53:02,746
>> GENTLEMEN, THE NEXT SERIES OF

1676
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:04,614
QUESTIONS DEALS WITH OBAMACARE

1677
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,14
AND THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL

1678
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:07,16
GOVERNMENT.

1679
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:10,86
MR. TRUMP, OBAMACARE IS ONE OF

1680
00:53:07,149 --> 00:53:10,987
THE THINGS YOU CALL A DISASTER.

1681
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:12,689
>> COMPLETE DISASTER, YES.

1682
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,923
>> SAYING IT NEEDS TO BE

1683
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,357
REPEALED AND REPLACED.

1684
00:53:14,56 --> 00:53:14,391
>> CORRECT.

1685
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,660
>> NOW 15 YEARS AGO YOU CALLED

1686
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:17,960
YOURSELF A LIBERAL ON HEALTH

1687
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,962
CARE.

1688
00:53:18,94 --> 00:53:23,266
YOU WERE FOR A SINGLE PAYER

1689
00:53:20,96 --> 00:53:25,268
SYSTEM, A CANADIAN STYLE SYSTEM.

1690
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,469
WHY WERE YOU FOR THAT THEN A

1691
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,37
WHY AREN'T YOU FOR IT NOW?

1692
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:31,541
>> FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO GO

1693
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:33,242
BACK TO ONE -- IN JULY OF 2004 I

1694
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:34,176
CAME OUT STRONGLY AGAINST THE

1695
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,345
WAR WITH IRAQ.

1696
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,647
BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO

1697
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,314
DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST.

1698
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,417
I'M THE ONLY ONE ON THE STAGE

1699
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:43,152
THAT KNEW THAT AND HAD THE

1700
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:44,821
VISION TO SAY IT AND THAT'S

1701
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:47,824
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

1702
00:53:44,954 --> 00:53:49,793
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY.

1703
00:53:47,957 --> 00:53:52,161
AS FAR AS SINGLE PAYER, IT WORKS

1704
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,962
IN CANADA, WORKS INCREDIBLY WELL

1705
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,531
IN SCOTLAND.

1706
00:53:53,95 --> 00:53:55,665
COULD HAVE WORKED IN A DIFFERENT

1707
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,232
AGE, WHICH IS THE AGE YOU'RE

1708
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,435
TALKING ABOUT HERE.

1709
00:53:56,365 --> 00:53:59,769
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS A

1710
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,870
PRIVATE SYSTEM WITHOUT THE

1711
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,671
ARTIFICIAL LINES AROUND EVERY

1712
00:54:01,3 --> 00:54:03,440
STATE.

1713
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:04,908
I HAVE A BIG COMPANY WITH

1714
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,941
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

1715
00:54:05,41 --> 00:54:08,578
EMPLOYEES AND IF I'M NEGOTIATING

1716
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:10,379
IN NEW YORK OR NEW JERSEY OR

1717
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:10,712
CALIFORNIA, I HAVE LIKE ONE

1718
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,247
BIDDER.

1719
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,281
NOBODY CAN BID.

1720
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,650
YOU KNOW WHY?

1721
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,819
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

1722
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:17,185
MAKING A FORTUNE BECAUSE THEY

1723
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,20
HAVE CONTROL OF THE POLITICIANS.

1724
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,322
OF COURSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

1725
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,957
THE POLITICIANS ON THE STAGE.

1726
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:22,91
BUT THEY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OF

1727
00:54:21,90 --> 00:54:24,427
THE POLITICIANS.

1728
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:24,461
THEY'RE MAKING A FORTUNE.

1729
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,931
GID RED OF THE ARTIFICIAL LINES

1730
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:27,964
AND YOU WILL HAVE YOURSELF GREAT

1731
00:54:28,64 --> 00:54:32,769
PLANS.

1732
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:35,104
THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE

1733
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:38,174
PEOPLE THAT CAN'T TAKE CARE OF

1734
00:54:35,237 --> 00:54:39,41
THEMSELVES ANDLY DO THAT IN A

1735
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:40,308
DIFFERENT SESSION.

1736
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,277
>> NEWS FLASH, THE REPUBLICAN

1737
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,979
PARTY HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST

1738
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,312
A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM FOR A

1739
00:54:43,112 --> 00:54:44,814
DECADE.

1740
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:47,316
I THINK YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE

1741
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:48,451
OF THIS IF YOU'RE STILL

1742
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,484
ARGUING --

1743
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,788
>> I DON'T THINK YOU HEARD ME.

1744
00:54:50,52 --> 00:54:52,121
YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME

1745
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,624
TONIGHT.

1746
00:54:52,254 --> 00:54:56,125
>> MR. TRUMP, IT'S NOT JUST YOUR

1747
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:57,159
PAST SUPPORT FOR SINGLE PAYER

1748
00:54:56,258 --> 00:55:04,265
HEALTH CARE.

1749
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:07,136
YOU'VE ALSO SUPPORTED A HOST OF

1750
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,770
OTHER LIBERAL POPOLICIES.

1751
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:08,337
YOU'VE DONATED TO SEVERAL

1752
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,5
DEMOCRAT CANDIDATES.

1753
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,439
YOU EXPLAINED AWAY THOSE

1754
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:12,475
DONATIONS SAYING YOU DID THAT TO

1755
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,509
GET BUSINESS-RELATED FAFRS.

1756
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,612
AND YOU SAID RECENTLY, QUOTE,

1757
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,913
WHEN YOU GIVE THEY DO WHATEVER

1758
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:20,348
THE HELL YOU WANT THEM TO DO.

1759
00:55:18,47 --> 00:55:22,819
>> YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

1760
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,85
>> WHAT SPECIFICALLY DID THEY

1761
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,888
DO?

1762
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:26,489
>> IF I ASK THEM, IF I NEED

1763
00:55:25,21 --> 00:55:26,523
THEM -- MOST OF THE PEOPLE ON

1764
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,25
THIS STAGE I'VE GIVEN TO, JUST

1765
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,92
TO YOU UNDERSTAND, A LOT OF

1766
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,193
MONEY.

1767
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,895
>> NOT ME.

1768
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,330
>> NOT ME.

1769
00:55:32,28 --> 00:55:36,533
>> YOU'RE WELCOME TO GIVE ME A

1770
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:40,469
CHECK, DONALD IF YOU WOULD LIKE.

1771
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:41,270
>> MANY OF THEM.

1772
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:44,306
>> I HAVE --

1773
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:44,941
>> I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE TO ME.

1774
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,11
>> GOOD.

1775
00:55:45,74 --> 00:55:48,44
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME, GOVERNOR.

1776
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,44
I WILL TELL YOU THAT OUR SYSTEM

1777
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,280
IS BROKEN.

1778
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:52,749
I GAVE TO MANY PEOPLE BEFORE

1779
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:54,350
THIS -- BEFORE TWO MONTHS AGO I

1780
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,652
WAS A BUSINESSMAN.

1781
00:55:54,483 --> 00:55:57,654
WHEN THEY CALL, I GIVE.

1782
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:59,154
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WHEN I NEED

1783
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:00,522
SOMETHING FROM THEM TWO YEARS

1784
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:00,557
LATER, THREE YEARS LATER, I CALL

1785
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,258
THEM.

1786
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,526
THEY ARE THERE FOR ME.

1787
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:03,560
THAT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM.

1788
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:09,298
>> WHAT DID YOU GET FROM HILLARY

1789
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:10,833
CLINTON AND NANCY PELOSI.

1790
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,301
>> FOR HILLARY CLINTON, I SAID

1791
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,69
BE AT ME WEDDING AND SHE CAME TO

1792
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,537
MY WEDDING.

1793
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:14,571
SHE HAD NO CHOICE BECAUSE I GAVE

1794
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:18,942
TO A FOUNDATION THAT FRANKLY

1795
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:19,709
THAT FOUNDATION IS SUPPOSED TO

1796
00:56:19,75 --> 00:56:21,611
DO GOOD.

1797
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:22,612
I DIDN'T KNOW HER MONEY WOULD BE

1798
00:56:21,744 --> 00:56:24,513
USED ON PRIVATE JETS GOING ALL

1799
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:25,615
OVER THE WORLD.

1800
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:27,116
IT WAS.

1801
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:27,817
>> MR. TRUMP, WE'RE GOING TO

1802
00:56:27,249 --> 00:56:29,685
MOVE ON.

1803
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,19
COMING BACK TO YOU GOVERNOR

1804
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,21
WALKER.

1805
00:56:30,152 --> 00:56:33,456
>> WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME

1806
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:34,256
TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.

1807
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,492
LET'S BE CLEAR.

1808
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,794
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT

1809
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,962
HILLARY CLINTON ON THAT LAST

1810
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,129
SUBJECT BECAUSE EVEWHERE IN

1811
00:56:39,95 --> 00:56:42,198
THE WORLD THAT HILLARY CLINTON

1812
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:43,633
TOUCHED IS MORE MESSED UP TODAY.

1813
00:56:42,331 --> 00:56:50,640
>> MANY QUESTIONS TO COME.

1814
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:51,273
>> GOVERNOR HUCKABEE, ON

1815
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:52,341
FACEBOOK, JOHN ASKED THIS.

1816
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,810
WILL YOU ABOLISH OR TAKE AWAY

1817
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:56,479
THE POWERS AND CUT THE SIZE OF

1818
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:57,580
THE EPA, THE IRS, THE DEPARTMENT

1819
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:57,614
OF EDUCATION?

1820
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:01,150
NOW BROADLY, BROADLY THE SIZE OF

1821
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:03,852
GOVERNMENT IS A BIG CONCERN FOR

1822
00:57:01,283 --> 00:57:05,989
A FACEBOOK USERS, FACEBOOK

1823
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,422
PERSONS AS WELL AS OBVIOUSLY

1824
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,757
CONSERVATIVES.

1825
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:09,859
BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR, DECADE

1826
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:11,426
AFTER DECADE, THERE ARE PROMISES

1827
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:11,828
FROM REPUBLICANS TO SHRINK

1828
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,429
VERNMENT.

1829
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,997
BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR, DECADE

1830
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:18,801
AFTER DECADE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

1831
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:19,902
IN FACT IT GETSFACT, IT GETS BI

1832
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,237
UNDER REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS.

1833
00:57:20,36 --> 00:57:23,673
THE QUESTION IS AT THIS POINT,

1834
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:25,207
IS THE GOVERNMENT SIMPLY TOO BIG

1835
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:28,778
FOR ANY ONE PERSON?

1836
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:30,379
EVEN A REPUBLICAN TO SHRINK?

1837
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:32,882
>> IT'S NOT TOO BIG TO SHRINK.

1838
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:34,517
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A WALL

1839
00:57:33,16 --> 00:57:35,985
STREET TO WASHINGTON ACCESS OF

1840
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,819
POWER THAT HAS CONTROLLED THE

1841
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,54
POLITICAL CLIMATE.

1842
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,988
THE DONOR CLASS FEEDS THE

1843
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:41,57
POLITICAL CLASS WHO DOES THE

1844
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,357
CLASS THAT THE DONOR CLASS

1845
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,659
WANTS.

1846
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:44,160
THE RESULT IS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

1847
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,427
KEEPS GETTING BIGGER.

1848
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:46,529
EVERY PERSON ON THIS STAGE WHO

1849
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:48,430
HAS BEEN A GOVERNOR WILL TELL

1850
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,866
THAT YOU THE BIGGEST FIGHT THEY

1851
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:51,734
HAD WAS NOT THE OTHER PART

1852
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:53,368
WASN'T EVEN THE LEGISLATURE.

1853
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:56,238
IT WAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

1854
00:57:53,502 --> 00:57:57,940
WHO CONTINUALLY PUT MANDATES ON

1855
00:57:56,405 --> 00:57:59,341
TH STATES THAT WE HAD TO SUCK

1856
00:57:58,74 --> 00:58:00,977
UP AND PAY FOR.

1857
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:02,211
THE FACT IS A LOT OF THING ARE

1858
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,814
HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

1859
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:05,915
THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE

1860
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:06,515
JURISDICTION OF THE

1861
00:58:06,49 --> 00:58:08,117
CONSTITUTION.

1862
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,218
THIS IS POWER THAT SHOULD BE

1863
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,587
SHIFTED BACK TO THE STATES,

1864
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:13,122
WHETHER THE EPA, THERE IS NO

1865
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,791
ROLE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR

1866
00:58:13,255 --> 00:58:17,126
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

1867
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:18,895
AND I'M STILL ONE WHO SAYS THAT

1868
00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:20,362
WE CAN GET RID OF THE INTERNAL

1869
00:58:19,28 --> 00:58:21,529
REVENUE SERVICE IF WE WOULD PASS

1870
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:23,166
THE FAIR TAX.

1871
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,199
A TAX ON CONSUMPTION RATHER THAN

1872
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:27,636
A TAX ON PEOPLE'S INCOME.

1873
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:30,139
AND MOVE POWER BACK WHERE THE

1874
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,674
FOUNDERS BELIEVED IT SHOULD HAVE

1875
00:58:30,272 --> 00:58:31,708
BEENLL ALONG.

1876
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:35,111
>> DR. CARSON, DO YOU AGREE WITH

1877
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,13
THAT?

1878
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:38,715
>> WHAT I AGREE WITH IS THAT WE

1879
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,215
NEED A SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED

1880
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:42,118
TAXATION SYSTEM.

1881
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:43,886
AND THE ONE THAT I'VE ADVOCATED

1882
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:45,955
IS BASED ON TITHING.

1883
00:58:44,20 --> 00:58:47,857
I THINK GOD IS A PRETTY FAIR

1884
00:58:46,89 --> 00:58:48,958
GUY.

1885
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:51,93
AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IF YOU

1886
00:58:49,92 --> 00:58:52,361
GIVE ME A TITHE, IT DOESN

1887
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:55,198
MATTER HOW MUCH YOU MAKE.

1888
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:55,231
IF YOU HAD A BUMPER CROP, YOU

1889
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:59,102
DON'T OWE ME TRIPLE.

1890
00:58:56,933 --> 00:59:03,272
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY KROMS,

1891
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:04,240
YOU DON'T OWE ME ANY TITHES.

1892
00:59:03,405 --> 00:59:05,41
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING FAIR

1893
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:08,878
ABOUT THAT.

1894
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:09,846
YOU MAKE $10, YOU PAY 1.

1895
00:59:09,11 --> 00:59:10,379
EVERYBODY GETS TREATED THE SAME

1896
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,548
WAY.

1897
00:59:10,512 --> 00:59:14,450
YOU GET RID OF THE DEDUCTIONS,

1898
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:15,184
ALL THE LOOPHOLES.

1899
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,818
>> RIGHT.

1900
00:59:15,317 --> 00:59:17,220
>> GOVERNOR BUSH?

1901
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,253
>> I HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY

1902
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,789
ABOUT IT.

1903
00:59:18,54 --> 00:59:21,257
>> WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU.

1904
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:25,128
>> GOVERNOR BUSH, YOU ARE ONE OF

1905
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:26,261
THE FEW PEOPLE ON THE STAGE WHO

1906
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,864
ADVOCATES FOR COMMON CORE

1907
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:28,163
EDUCATION STANDARDS, READING AND

1908
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:31,134
MATH.

1909
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:32,902
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS STAGE

1910
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,301
VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE FEDERAL

1911
00:59:33,35 --> 00:59:36,105
INVOLVEMENT.

1912
00:59:33,435 --> 00:59:36,639
THEY SAY IT SHOULD ALL BE HAND

1913
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,174
LOCALLY.

1914
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:39,976
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SECRETARY OF

1915
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:41,410
EDUCATION, ARNIE DUNK AN, HAS

1916
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:43,612
SAID MOST OF THE CRITICISM OF

1917
00:59:41,543 --> 00:59:45,47
COMMON CORE IS DUE TO A, QUOTE,

1918
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,182
FRINGE GROUP OF CRITICS.

1919
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,849
DO YOU THINK THAT'S ACCURATE?

1920
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:47,349
>> NO.

1921
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,251
I DON'T.

1922
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:48,284
I DON'T BELIEVE THE FEDERAL

1923
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:50,920
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN

1924
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,454
THE CREATION OF STANDARDS

1925
00:59:51,53 --> 00:59:59,261
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.

1926
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:59,295
THE CREATION OF CURRICULUM

1927
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,297
CONTENT.

1928
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:04,133
I'M FOR HIGHER STANDARDS,

1929
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:06,803
MEASURE IN THE AN INTELLECTUALLY

1930
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:08,171
HONEST WAY WITH ABUNDANT SCHOOL

1931
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,470
CHOICE, AND I KNOW HOW TO DO

1932
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:09,438
THIS.

1933
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:11,140
AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF

1934
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:13,709
FLORIDA I CREATED THE FIRST

1935
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,42
STATEWIDE VOUCHER PROGRAM IN THE

1936
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:14,777
COUNTRY.

1937
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:14,811
THE SECOND STATEWIDE VOUCHER

1938
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:18,281
PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY AND THE

1939
01:00:17,46 --> 01:00:18,314
THIRD IN THE COUNTRY.

1940
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:19,315
WE HAD RISING STUDENT

1941
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:23,286
ACHIEVEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD.

1942
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:23,319
BECAUSE HIGH STANDARDS, ROBUST

1943
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:26,989
ACCOUNTABILITY, ENDING SOCIAL

1944
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:28,290
PROMOTION IN THIRD GRADE.

1945
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,324
REAL SCHOOL CHOICE ACROSS THE

1946
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,559
BOARD.

1947
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,895
CHALLENGING THE TEACHER'S UNIT

1948
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,162
AND BEATING THEM IS THE WAY TO

1949
01:00:33,29 --> 01:00:34,230
GO.

1950
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,631
AND FLORIDA HAD THE GREATEST

1951
01:00:34,363 --> 01:00:37,765
GAINS INSIDE THE COUNTRY.

1952
01:00:35,764 --> 01:00:38,34
OUR GRADUATION RATE IMPROVED BY

1953
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,635
50%.

1954
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,804
THAT'S WHAT I'M FOR.

1955
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:41,838
>> SENATOR RUBIO, WHY IS

1956
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,772
GOVERNOR BUSH WRONG ON COMMON

1957
01:00:43,572 --> 01:00:45,908
CORE?

1958
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:46,241
>> TIE BELIEVE IN CURRICULUM

1959
01:00:46,42 --> 01:00:48,310
REFORM.

1960
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:48,344
IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

1961
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:51,314
WE DO BELIEVE CURRICULUM REFORM

1962
01:00:50,412 --> 01:00:51,346
AND IT SHOULD HAPPEN AT THE

1963
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,417
STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL.

1964
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,750
THAT'S WHERE EDUCATIONAL POLICY

1965
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,186
BELONGS.

1966
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,420
BECAUSE IF A PARENT IS UNHAPPY

1967
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,522
WITH WHAT THEIR CHILD IS BEING

1968
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:01,891
TAUGHT IN SCHOOL, THEY CAN GO TO

1969
01:01:00,656 --> 01:01:03,359
THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD OR THE

1970
01:01:02,24 --> 01:01:04,593
GOVERNOR AND GET IT CHANGED.

1971
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:04,894
HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH XLONL

1972
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,627
CORE.

1973
01:01:05,27 --> 01:01:08,331
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LIKE

1974
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:08,364
EVERY FEDERAL AGENCY WILL NEVER

1975
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,632
BE SATISFIED.

1976
01:01:09,98 --> 01:01:11,300
THEY WILL NOT STOP WITH IT BEING

1977
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:13,102
A SUGGESTION.

1978
01:01:11,433 --> 01:01:13,435
THEY WILL TURN IT INTO A

1979
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:15,171
MANDATE.

1980
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:16,638
WHAT THEY WILL BEGIN TO SAY TO

1981
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,174
LOCAL COMMUNITIES IS YOU WILL

1982
01:01:16,772 --> 01:01:20,877
NOT GET FEDERAL MONEY UNLESS DO

1983
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:21,142
YOU THING WAY WE WANT YOU TO DO

1984
01:01:21,10 --> 01:01:22,378
IT.

1985
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,812
AND THEY WILL USE COMMON CORE OR

1986
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:25,114
ANY OTHER REQUIREMENTS TO FORCE

1987
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,249
IT DOWN THE THROATS OF THE

1988
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:29,752
PEOPLE IN OUR STATES.

1989
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:30,86
>> DO YOU AGREE WITH YOUR OLD

1990
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:33,154
FRIEND?

1991
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,822
>> HE IS DEFINITELY MY FRIEND.

1992
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:34,590
I THINK E STATES OUGHT TO

1993
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,992
CREATE THE STANDARDS FMPL STATES

1994
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:37,360
WANT TOMENT ON OUT, FINE.

1995

JUST MAKE SURE YOUR STANDARDS

1996
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:39,495
ARE HIGH.

1997
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:41,697
BECAUSE TODAY IN AMERICA, A

1998
01:01:39,628 --> 01:01:43,99
THIRD OF OUR KIDS, AFTER WE

1999
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,665
SPEND MORE PER STUDENT THAN ANY

2000
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:47,736
OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD OTHER

2001
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,538

2002
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,38
TO BE HONEST, 30% ARE COLLEGE OR

2003
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:51,339
CAREER READY.

2004
01:01:50,172 --> 01:01:52,708
IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPETE IN

2005
01:01:51,473 --> 01:01:54,944
THIS WORLD TODAY, THERE IS NO

2006
01:01:52,841 --> 01:01:56,212
POSSIBLE WAY WE CAN DO IT WITH

2007
01:01:55,77 --> 01:01:57,513
LOWERING EXPECTATIONS AND

2008
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,981
DUMBING DOWN EVERYTHING.

2009
01:01:57,646 --> 01:02:00,16
CHILDREN WILL SUFFER AND

2010
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,683
FAMILIES' HEARTS WILL BE BROKEN

2011
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:04,86
THAT THEIR KIDS WON'T BE ABLE TO

2012
01:02:01,817 --> 01:02:05,321
GET A JOB IN THE 21st CENTURY.

2013

01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:10,986
THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE MANY

2043
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:12,20
ROUNDS AND BITS SOMEBODY WHOSE

2044
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,256
NAME PROBABLY HANDLE BEEN

2045
01:03:12,154 --> 01:03:14,856
MENTIONED ENOUGH RIGHT NOW.

2046
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,491
GOVERNOR KASICH.

2047
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:18,526
LET ME START WITH YOU.

2048
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:21,930
WHOEVER THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE

2049
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,998
IS, IT LOOKS AT LEAST FOR NOW

2050
01:03:22,64 --> 01:03:25,767
LIKE WHOEVER THAT NOMINEE IS, HE

2051
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:26,335
OR SHE WILL BE FACING OFF AGAIN

2052
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:28,169
HILLARY CLINTON.

2053
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:30,539
YOU KNOW HOW SHE WILL COME AFTER

2054
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,872
WHOEVER THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE

2055
01:03:30,672 --> 01:03:32,341
IS.

2056
01:03:31,6 --> 01:03:34,109
SHE WILL SAY THAT YOU, WHOEVER

2057
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:36,612
IT IS, SUPPORT THE RICH WHILE

2058
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:38,481
SHE SUPPORTS THE MIDDLE CLASS.

2059
01:03:36,745 --> 01:03:40,816
THAT YOU WANT TO SUPPRESS THE

2060
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:42,118
RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES.

2061
01:03:40,949 --> 01:03:43,486
SHE WANTS TO MOVE THE COUNTRY

2062
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:44,753
FORWARD WHILE YOU THE

2063
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,888
REPUBLICANS WANT TO TAKE THE

2064
01:03:44,886 --> 01:03:49,358
COUNTRY BACK TO THE PAST.

2065
01:03:47,22 --> 01:03:50,392
HOW WILL YOU, IF YOU'RE THE

2066
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,793
NOMINEE, HOW WILL YOU ANSWER

2067
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,60
THAT AND TAKE HILLARY CLINTON

2068
01:03:51,927 --> 01:03:53,496
ON?

2069
01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:55,297
>> LET'S START OFF WITH MY

2070
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:57,133
FATHER BEING A MAILMAN.

2071
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:59,235
I UNDERSTAND THE KERNELS OF ALL

2072
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:01,103
THE FOLKS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.

2073
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,136
SOME OF WHOM HAVE TROUBLE MAKING

2074
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:04,39
ENDS MEET.

2075
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:04,839
I THINK SHE WILL COME IN THE

2076
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,674
NARROW WAY.

2077
01:04:04,973 --> 01:04:09,745
THE NOMINEE OF THIS PARTY HAS TO

2078
01:04:06,808 --> 01:04:10,78
COME AT IT IN A BIG WAY, PRO

2079
01:04:09,878 --> 01:04:11,413
GROWTH.

2080
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:12,181
WHICH IS BALANCING BUDGETS.

2081
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,582
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT.

2082
01:04:12,314 --> 01:04:13,915
PEOPLE WERE SAYING COULD WE DO

2083
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:15,751
IT?

2084
01:04:14,49 --> 01:04:17,586
I WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET

2085
01:04:15,884 --> 01:04:19,87
COMMITTEE AND THE LEAD ARCHITECT

2086
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:19,488
THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED IN

2087
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:21,157
WASHINGTON.

2088
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:21,690
WHEN WE DID IT, WE HAD GREAT

2089
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,426
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

2090
01:04:21,823 --> 01:04:24,859
WE KUPT TAXES AND WE HAD A BIG

2091
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,362
SURPLUS.

2092
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:29,31
ECONOMIC GROWTH IS THE KEY.

2093
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:29,431
ECONOMIC GROWTH IS THE KEY TO

2094
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:30,366
EVERYTHING.

2095
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:31,700
BUT ONCE YOU HAVE ECONOMIC

2096
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,234
GROWTH, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

2097
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:35,371
REACH OUT TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

2098
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,938
THE SHADOWS, THE PEOPLE WHO

2099
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:38,106
DON'T SEEM TO EVER THINK THEY

2100
01:04:37,72 --> 01:04:40,409
GET A FAIR DEAL.

2101
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,243
AND THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE IN OUR

2102
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,345
MINORITY COMMUNITY, THAT

2103
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,481
INCLUDES PEOPLE WHO FEEL AS

2104
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:46,448
THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE A CHANCE

2105
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:47,783
TO MOVE UP.

2106
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:50,286
AMERICA IS A MIRACLE COUNTRY.

2107
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:51,887
AND WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE

2108
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,520
EXPEE THE MIRACLE WILL APPLY

2109
01:04:52,20 --> 01:04:54,657
TO YOU.

2110
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:54,690
EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE PEOPLE

2111
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:58,661
IN THIS COUNTRY WHO IS WATCHING

2112
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,694
TONIGHT, LIFT EVERYBODY, UNITE

2113
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:02,698
EVERYBODY, AND BUILD A STRONGER

2114
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:04,500
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AGAIN.

2115
01:05:02,831 --> 01:05:06,134
IT WILL BE AND CAN BE DONE.

2116
01:05:04,633 --> 01:05:07,636
>> I KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU WOULD

2117
01:05:06,268 --> 01:05:08,904
LIKE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT

2118
01:05:07,769 --> 01:05:10,839
WE'RE ONLY GOING ON ASK ONE

2119
01:05:09,37 --> 01:05:12,40
OTHER CANDIDATE BEFORE WE MOVE

2120
01:05:10,972 --> 01:05:13,775
TO A DIFFERENT SUBJECT.

2121
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,142
DR. CARSON, SAME QUESTION TO

2122
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:15,544
YOU.

2123
01:05:14,276 --> 01:05:16,877
IF HILLARY CNTON IS THE

2124
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:18,814
NOMINEE AND SHE COMES AT YOU

2125
01:05:17,12 --> 01:05:20,683
WITH THAT KIND OF LINE OF

2126
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:20,716
ATTACK, HOW WILL YOU TAKE HER

2127
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:22,384
ON?

2128
01:05:21,149 --> 01:05:25,721
>> IF HILLARY IS THE CANDIDATE,

2129
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:26,755
WHICH I DOUBT, THAT WOULD BE A

2130
01:05:25,854 --> 01:05:29,24
DREAM COME TRUE.

2131
01:05:26,888 --> 01:05:33,261
BUT YOU KNOW, THE FACT OF THE

2132
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:37,132
MATTER IS, SHE IS THE EPITOME OF

2133
01:05:33,395 --> 01:05:38,166
THE PROGRESSIVE, THE SECULAR

2134
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,302
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT.

2135
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:43,472
AND SHE COUNTS ON THE FACT THAT

2136
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:46,108
PEOPLE ARE UNINFORMED.

2137
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:47,42
THE MODEL TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

2138
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,10
USEFUL IDIOTS.

2139
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:50,379
I JUST HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT

2140
01:05:49,144 --> 01:05:52,381
PEOPLE ARE NOT STUPID.

2141
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:53,549
AND THE WAY I WILL COME AT I IS

2142
01:05:52,514 --> 01:05:56,952
TO EDUCATE PEOPLE.

2143
01:05:53,682 --> 01:05:58,354
HELP PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY

2144
01:05:57,85 --> 01:06:00,522
UNDERSTAND THAT IS THE

2145
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,22
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT CAUSING THE

2146
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:03,558
PROBLEMS.

2147
01:06:01,156 --> 01:06:04,926
YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL DEBT

2148
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:07,329
AND HOW IT IS BEING DRIVEN UP.

2149
01:06:05,60 --> 01:06:09,231
IF I WAS TRYING TO DESTROY THIS

2150
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,265
COUNTRY, WHAT I WOULD DO IS FIND

2151
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,133
A WAY TO DRIVE WEDGES BETWEEN

2152
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,968
THE PEOPLE.

2153
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,868
DRIVE TO DEBT ON AN

2154
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:15,837
UNSUSTAINABLE LEVEL AND THEN

2155
01:06:14,2 --> 01:06:17,373
STEP OFF THE STAGE AS A WORLD

2156
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:19,408
LEADER AND LET OUR ENEMIES

2157
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:20,808
INCREASE WHILE WE DECREASED OUR

2158
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:26,548
CAPACITY AS A MILITARY PERSON.

2159
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:29,184
THAT'S WHAT SHE IS DOING.

2160
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:30,986
>> GENTLEMEN, WE'LL TURN NOW TO

2161
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,554
THE SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMY, JOBS

2162
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,989
AND MONEY AND THE GOVERNMENT.

2163
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,757
AND GOVERNOR BUSH, I'M GOING TO

2164
01:06:34,122 --> 01:06:34,790
START WITH YOU.

2165
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,225
YOU'VE MADE A BOLD PROMISE IN

2166
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:40,696
YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT.

2167
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:42,898
YOU HAVE PROMISED 4% ECONOMIC

2168
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:44,333
GROWTH AND 19 MILLION NEW JOBS

2169
01:06:43,31 --> 01:06:46,335
IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO

2170
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:48,370
SERVE TWO TERMS AS PRESIDENT.

2171
01:06:46,468 --> 01:06:49,738
THAT MANY JOBS, 19 MILLION,

2172
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:52,607
WOULD BE TRIPLE WHAT YOUR FATHER

2173
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:52,974
AND YOUR BROTHER ACCOMPLISHED

2174
01:06:52,741 --> 01:06:54,109
TOGETHER.

2175
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:55,644
AND 4% GROWTH.

2176
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:57,212
THE LAST PRESIDENT TO AVERAGE

2177
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:59,682
THAT WAS LYNDON JOHNSON DURING

2178
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,816
THE HEIGHT OF THE VIETNAM WAR.

2179
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:02,618
SO QUESTION.

2180
01:07:00,949 --> 01:07:03,919
HOW ON EARTH SPECIFICALLY WOULD

2181
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:06,588
YOU PULL THAT OFF?

2182
01:07:04,52 --> 01:07:07,55
>> WE'VE DONE IT 27 TIMES SINCE

2183
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,57
WORLD WAR II.

2184
01:07:07,222 --> 01:07:11,159
I THINK WE NEED TO LIFT OUR

2185
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:12,26
SPIRITS AND HAVE HIGH LOFTY

2186
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,828
EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS GREAT

2187
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,696
COUNTRY OF OURS.

2188
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:16,497
THE NEW NORMAL OF 2%, THAT THE

2189
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:18,200
LEFT IS SAYING, YOU CAN'T DO

2190
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:19,835
ANYTHING ABOUT, IS SO DANGEROUS

2191
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,803
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

2192
01:07:19,968 --> 01:07:20,836
THERE ARE 6 MILLION PEOPLE

2193
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:23,572
LIVING IN POVERTY TODAY.

2194
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,239
MORE THAN WHEN BARACK OBAMA GOT

2195
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,741
ELECTED.

2196
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,676
6.5 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WORKING

2197
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:30,145
PART TIME.

2198
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,446
MOST OF WHOM WANT TO WORK FULL

2199
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:32,214
TIME.

2200
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,716
WE'VE CREATED RULES AND TAXES ON

2201
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,317
EVERY ASPIRATION OF PEOPLE.

2202
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,351
THE NET RESULT IS WE'RE NOT

2203
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:37,519
GROWING FAST.

2204
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:40,21
INCOME IS NOT GROWING.

2205
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:42,491
A 4% GROWTH STRATEGY MEANS YOU

2206
01:07:40,155 --> 01:07:45,26
FIX A CONVOLUTED TAX CODE.

2207
01:07:42,624 --> 01:07:46,562
YOU GET IN AND CHANGE EVERY AS

2208
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,663
THAT HE CAN OF JOB KILLERS.

2209
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:49,898
YOU GET RID OF OBAMACARE AND

2210
01:07:48,797 --> 01:07:52,668
REPLACE WITH IT SOMETHING THAT

2211
01:07:50,31 --> 01:07:52,968
DOESN'T SUPPRESS WAGES AND KILL

2212
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:54,536
JOBS.

2213
01:07:53,101 --> 01:07:55,637
YOU EMBRACE THE ENERGY

2214
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,572
REVOLUTION IN OUR COUNTRY.

2215
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,973
THIS PRESIDENT AND HILLARY

2216
01:07:56,705 --> 01:08:00,542
CLINTON WHO CAN'T EVEN SAY SHE

2217
01:07:58,106 --> 01:08:01,410
IS FOR THE XL I'M THAT LINE EVEN

2218
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,678
AFTER SHE'S LEFT?

2219
01:08:01,543 --> 01:08:04,446
OF COURSE WE'RE FOR IT.

2220
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:05,748
WE SHOULD BE FOR THESE THINGS TO

2221
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,115
SUSTAIN HIGH ECONOMIC GROWTH.

2222
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,216
AND FIXING OUR IMMIGRATION

2223
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,317
SYST AND TURNING IT INTO AN

2224
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:09,951
ECONOMIC DRIVER IS PART OF THIS

2225
01:08:09,451 --> 01:08:12,20
AS WELL.

2226
01:08:10,85 --> 01:08:14,623
WE CAN DO THIS.

2227
01:08:12,153 --> 01:08:16,392
>> GOVERNOR WALKER -- GOVERNOR

2228
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,394
WALKER, WHEN YOU RAN FOR

2229
01:08:16,524 --> 01:08:21,362
GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN, BACK IN

2230
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:21,397
2010, YOU PROMISED THAT YOU

2231
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:25,33
WOULD CREATE 250,000 JOBS IN

2232
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:26,100
YOUR FIRST TERM.

2233
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:28,404
FIRST FOUR YEARS.

2234
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:31,306
IN FACT, WISCONSIN ADDED BARELY

2235
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:32,641
HALF THAT AND RANKED 35th IN THE

2236
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,341
COUNTRY IN JOB GROWTH.

2237
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:36,243
NOW YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT

2238
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:38,279
AND YOU'RE PROMISING AN ECONOMIC

2239
01:08:36,377 --> 01:08:40,715
PLAN IN WHICH EVERYONE WILL EARN

2240
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:42,651
A PIECE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.

2241
01:08:40,849 --> 01:08:44,319
GIVEN YOUR RECORD IN WISCONSIN,

2242
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:46,86
WHY SHOULD VOTERS BELIEVE YOU?

2243
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,456
>> WELL, THE VOTERS IN WISCONSIN

2244
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:50,425
ELECTED ME LAST YEAR FOR THE

2245
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:51,693
THIRD TIME BECAUSE THEY WANTED

2246
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,960
SOMEONE WHO AIMED HIGH AND NOT

2247
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:54,730
LOW.

2248
01:08:52,93 --> 01:08:55,898
BEFORE I CAME IN, THE

2249
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:55,931
UNEMPLOYMENT WAS 8%.

2250
01:08:56,31 --> 01:08:59,535
IT IS NOW 4.6%.

2251
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:00,969
WE'VE MORE THAN MADE UP FOR THE

2252
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:02,871
JOBS LOST IN THE RECESSION AND

2253
01:09:01,102 --> 01:09:04,339
THE RATE OF PEOPLE WORKING IS

2254
01:09:03,4 --> 01:09:04,740
ALMOST 5 POINTS HIGHER THAN

2255
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,207
NATIONALLY.

2256
01:09:04,872 --> 01:09:08,544
PEOPLE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON

2257
01:09:06,341 --> 01:09:10,813
THINK YOU GROW THE WHICH I BY

2258
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:12,313
GROWING WASHINGTON.

2259
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,515
ONE OF THE TOP SIX COUNTIES WERE

2260
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:14,716
IN AND AROUND WASHINGTON, D.C.

2261
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,618
I THINK MOST OF US UNDERSTAND

2262
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,19
THAT PEOPLE, NOT THE GOVERNMENT

2263
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,488
CREATES JOBLGS.

2264
01:09:18,153 --> 01:09:22,825
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE CAN DO

2265
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:24,326
IS REPEAL OBAMACARE, REIGN IN

2266
01:09:22,957 --> 01:09:26,728
ALL THE OUT OF CONTROL

2267
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,696
RELATIONS, PUT IN AN ALL NEW

2268
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:29,631
ENERGY POLICY.

2269
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,800
GIVE FEMALE SKILLS TY NEED TO

2270
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:35,3
SUCCEED AND LOWER THE TAX RATE

2271
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:36,404
AND REFORM TAX CODE.

2272
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:39,641
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

2273
01:09:36,537 --> 01:09:41,609
>> GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, I WANT TO

2274
01:09:39,774 --> 01:09:44,612
ENGAGE AND YOU GOVERNOR HUCKABEE

2275
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:45,481
THAT IS A BIG SUBJECT IN BOTH

2276
01:09:44,746 --> 01:09:46,181
YOUR CAMPAIGNS.

2277
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:48,15
ENTITLEMENT CAMPAIGN.

2278
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:49,651
YOU SAY TO SAVE THE SYSTEM, YOU

2279
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:49,918
WANT TO RAISE THE RETIREMENT

2280
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:51,752
AGE.

2281
01:09:50,51 --> 01:09:52,20
HAVE TO RAISE THE RETIREMENT

2282
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:54,923
AGE.

2283
01:09:52,153 --> 01:09:56,391
AND TO CUT BENEFITS FOR SOCIAL

2284
01:09:55,56 --> 01:09:57,459
SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND YOU

2285
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,492
SAY SOME OF THE CANDIDATES ON

2286
01:09:57,593 --> 01:10:00,762
THE STAGE ARE LYING.

2287
01:09:59,394 --> 01:10:03,331
GOVERNOR HUCKABEE SAYS HE CAN

2288
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:05,567
SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY AND

2289
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,868
MEDICARE WITHOUT DOING ANY OF

2290
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,668
THAT.

2291
01:10:06,1 --> 01:10:07,369
IS HE LYING?

2292
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:08,570
>> NO.

2293
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,638
HE'S JUST WRONG.

2294
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,39
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

2295
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:14,809
LISTEN, I'M THE ONLY GUY ON THIS

2296
01:10:11,172 --> 01:10:16,477
STAGE WHO HAS PUT OUT A DETAILED

2297
01:10:14,943 --> 01:10:16,512
12-POINT PLAN AND HERE'S WHY.

2298
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:21,249
71% OF FEDERAL SPENDING RIGHT

2299
01:10:18,413 --> 01:10:22,49
NOW IS ON ENTITLEMENT AND DEBT

2300
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:22,317
SERVICE.

2301
01:10:22,183 --> 01:10:23,819
71%.

2302
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:25,353
AND WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST HOUR

2303
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:26,354
AND FIVE MINUTES TALKING ABOUT

2304
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:28,624
THE OTHER 29%.

2305
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:30,325
AND NO TIME ON THE FUN%.

2306
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:32,326
AND THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

2307
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:34,996
LET ME TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT WE

2308
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:35,30
WOULD DO ON SOCIAL SECURITY YES.

2309
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,266
HE WITH WOULD RAISE THE

2310
01:10:37,432 --> 01:10:40,434
RETIREMENT AGE OVER 25 YEARS.

2311
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,202
ONE MONTH A YEAR FOR 25 YEARS.

2312
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:44,339
WHEN WE'RE ALL LIVING LONGER AND

2313
01:10:42,337 --> 01:10:45,707
LIVING BETTER LIVES.

2314
01:10:44,472 --> 01:10:46,441
SECONDLY, WE WOULD MEANS TEST

2315
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:49,210
SOCIAL SECURITY.

2316
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:50,946
FOR THOSE MAKING OVER $200,000 A

2317
01:10:49,344 --> 01:10:55,450
YEAR IN RETIREMENT INCOME AND

2318
01:10:51,79 --> 01:10:56,884
HAVE $4 TO $5 MILLION IN LIQUID

2319
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:58,86
ASSETS SAVED, THEY DON'T NEED

2320
01:10:57,19 --> 01:11:00,656
SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK.

2321
01:10:58,219 --> 01:11:03,792
THAT IS MEANT FOR NO ONE WHO HAS

2322
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:05,626
WORKED HARD AND PLAYED BY THE

2323
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,663
RULES GROWS OLD IN POVERTY.

2324
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:08,931
IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH THIS, IT

2325
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:09,765
WILL BANKRUPT OUR COUNTRY OR

2326
01:11:09,64 --> 01:11:10,766
LEAD TO MASSIVE.

2327
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:14,536
AT A INCREASES.

2328
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,570
NEITHER ONE DO WE WANT IN THIS

2329
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,338
COUNTRY.

2330
01:11:15,3 --> 01:11:19,708
>> GOVERNOR HUCKABEE, YOU SAY

2331
01:11:17,472 --> 01:11:20,809
THE CHANGING ENTITLEMENTS, THE

2332
01:11:19,841 --> 01:11:22,510
KIND OF THING GOVERNOR CHRISTIE

2333
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,411
IS TALKING ABOUT, WOULD BE

2334
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:24,279
BREAKING A PROMISE TO THE

2335
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:27,215
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

2336
01:11:24,412 --> 01:11:28,951
YOU SAY YOU CAN KEEP THOSE

2337
01:11:27,348 --> 01:11:30,285
PROGRAMS, SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY,

2338
01:11:29,84 --> 01:11:32,387
SAVE MEDICARE WITHOUT THOSE

2339
01:11:30,418 --> 01:11:32,654
KINDS OF REFORMS THROUGH A FAIR

2340
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,123
TAX.

2341
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:36,724
A BROAD TAX ON CONSUMPTION.

2342
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:38,93
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO GOVERNOR

2343
01:11:36,858 --> 01:11:39,728
CHRISTIE HOW THAT WOULD WORK AND

2344
01:11:38,226 --> 01:11:41,597
HOW YOU CAN SAVE THESE PROGRAMS

2345
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:42,965
WITHOUT THE KIND OF PAINFUL

2346
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,700
REFORM HE SAYS WE NEED.

2347
01:11:43,98 --> 01:11:47,970
>> LET'S ALL BE REMINDED.

2348
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:48,570
60 MILLION AMERICANS ARE ON

2349
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:48,604
SOCIAL SECURITY.

2350
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,839
60 MILLION.

2351
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:53,575
A THIRD OF THOSE PEOPLE DEPEND

2352
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,609
ON 90% OF THE INCOME FROM SOCIAL

2353
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,510
SECURITY.

2354
01:11:54,76 --> 01:11:56,277
NOBODY IN THIS COUNTRY IS ON

2355
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,579
SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE THEY

2356
01:11:56,411 --> 01:11:57,613
MADE THE DECISION WHEN THEY WERE

2357
01:11:57,713 --> 01:12:00,548
STARTING WORK AT 14 THAT THEY

2358
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,950
WANTED TO TRUST SOME OF THEIR

2359
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:03,684
MONEY WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

2360
01:12:02,84 --> 01:12:05,53
THE GOVERNMENT TOOK IT OUT OF

2361
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,887
THEIR CHECK WHETHER THEY WANT

2362
01:12:05,186 --> 01:12:08,289
THEM TO OR NOT.

2363
01:12:06,21 --> 01:12:10,125
IF A PERSON GOES TO 65, THEY

2364
01:12:08,423 --> 01:12:11,392
WILL SPEND 51 YEARS WITH A

2365
01:12:10,258 --> 01:12:13,662
GOVERNMENT REACHING INTO THEIR

2366
01:12:11,526 --> 01:12:14,696
POCKET AT EVERY PAYCHECK.

2367
01:12:13,795 --> 01:12:15,998
HERE'S THE POINT.

2368
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,99
WHOSE FAULT IS THAT IT THE

2369
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,132
SYSTEM IS SCREWED UP?

2370
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:21,536
IS IT THE RECIPIENTS OR THE

2371
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:23,238
GOVERNMENT?

2372
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,740
IF CONGRESS WANTS TO MESS WITH

2373
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:26,374
THE RETIREMENT PROGRAM, WHY

2374
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:27,407
DON'T WE LET THEM START BY

2375
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,44
CHANGING THEIR RETIREMENT

2376
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:31,246
PROGRAM AND NOT HAVE ONE INSTEAD

2377
01:12:29,177 --> 01:12:33,749
OF TALKING ABOUT GETTING RID OF

2378
01:12:31,379 --> 01:12:37,485
SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE

2379
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:38,853
THAT WAS ROBBED $700 BILLION TO

2380
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,587
PAY FOR OBAMACARE?

2381
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,256
IT IS ALWAYS THE GOVERNMENT

2382
01:12:39,721 --> 01:12:43,659
FIGURES THEY CAN DO THIS OFF THE

2383
01:12:41,389 --> 01:12:46,327
BACKS OF PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM

2384
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,628
ARE POOR AND DEPEND ON THAT

2385
01:12:46,461 --> 01:12:46,662
MONEY.

2386
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:48,929
I THINK IT IS LYING TO THE

2387
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:51,66
PEOPLE AND STEALING FROM THEM

2388
01:12:49,64 --> 01:12:52,67
AND WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING IT.

2389
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,000
>> CHRIS?

2390
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,436
>> 30 SECONDS.

2391
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:57,405
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ENDING

2392
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:58,674
CONGRESS'S RETIREMENT PROGRAM.

2393
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,875
I'M A GOVERNOR AND I DON'T HAVE

2394
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:01,409
A RETIREMENT PROGRAM.

2395
01:13:00,42 --> 01:13:01,743
HE'S THE NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN

2396
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:02,710
PEOPLE.

2397
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,479
HE IS COMPLAING ABOUT THE

2398
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:06,915
LYING AND STEALING.

2399
01:13:04,612 --> 01:13:09,151
IT HAS ALREADY OCCURRED.

2400
01:13:07,49 --> 01:13:09,184
THE TRUST FUND IS FILLED WITH

2401
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,687
IOUs.

2402
01:13:10,85 --> 01:13:13,354
WE CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM WITH

2403
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,90
JUST CONGRESS' RETIREMENT.

2404
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:17,525
THAT'S WORTH THIS MUCH.

2405
01:13:15,223 --> 01:13:17,859
WE NEED TO GO TO THE FUNDAMENTAL

2406
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,460
PROBLEM.

2407
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:22,330
THIS SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

2408
01:13:20,595 --> 01:13:24,332
IT HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM.

2409
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:25,433
WE ND STRONG LEADER TO FIX IT.

2410
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:28,203
>> 30 SECONDS FINALLY.

2411
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,870
>> YOU ASK ABOUT HOW WE FUND IT.

2412
01:13:28,336 --> 01:13:30,5
ONE OF THE REASONS SOCIAL

2413
01:13:29,4 --> 01:13:31,106
SECURITY IS IN TROUBLE.

2414
01:13:30,138 --> 01:13:32,774
THE ONLY FUNDING STREAM COME

2415
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:35,9
FROM PEOPLE WHO GET A WAGE.

2416
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,376
THE PEOPLE WHO GET WAGES IS

2417
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:36,644
DECLINING.

2418
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:39,247
MOST OF THE INCOME IS MADE BY

2419
01:13:36,778 --> 01:13:41,183
PEOPLE AT THE TOP WHO GET

2420
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,216
DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS.

2421
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:44,786
THE FAIR TAX TRANSFORMS THE

2422
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:46,188
PROCESS BY WHICH WE FUND SOCIAL

2423
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,221
SECURITY AND MEDICARE BECAUSE

2424
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:51,26
THE MONEY PAID AT CONSUMPTION IS

2425
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:55,797
PAID BY EVERYBODY INCLUDING

2426
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:57,232
ILLEGALS, PIMPS, EVERYBODY FREE

2427
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:59,433
LOADING OFF IT NOW.

2428
01:13:57,365 --> 01:14:00,434
THAT'S WHY IT OUGHT TO BE A

2429
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:01,669
TRANSFORMED SYSTEM.

2430
01:14:00,568 --> 01:14:02,303
>> ALL RIGHT.

2431
01:14:01,803 --> 01:14:03,71

MR. TRUMP --

2433
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:10,245

2435
01:14:10,378 --> 01:14:11,880
ON THE STAGE TO GROW THE

2436
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,182
ECONOMY.

2437
01:14:12,13 --> 01:14:15,817
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR

2438
01:14:14,315 --> 01:14:16,751

HOTELS, HAVE DECLARED BANKRUPTCY

2442
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:22,657
FOUR TIMES OVER THE LAST QUARTER

2443
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:25,961
CENTURY.

COUNTRY TO MY ADVANTAGE.

2448
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:34,402
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, FINANCIAL

2449
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:36,537
EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THOSE

2450
01:14:34,535 --> 01:14:38,439
BANKRUPTCIES SAY LENDERS TO YOUR

2451
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,7
COMPANIES LOST BILLIONS OF

2452
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:40,475
COMPANIES.

2453
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,343
QUESTION, SIR WORK THAT RECORD,

2456
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:48,750
>> BECAUSE I HAVE USED THE LAWS

2457
01:14:46,714 --> 01:14:48,784

ABOUT EVERY DAY IN BUSINESS HAVE

2460
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:56,324
USED THE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY,

2461
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:58,326
THE CHAPTER LAWS, TO DO A GREAT

2462
01:14:56,457 --> 01:15:00,896
JOB FOR MY COMPANY, FOR MYSELF,

2463

FOR MY EMPLOYEES, FOR MY FAMILY,

2464
01:15:01,29 --> 01:15:03,64
ET CETERA.

01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:16,611
>> WHAT AM I SAYING?

2473
01:15:14,9 --> 01:15:18,346
OUT OF HUNDREDS OF DEAL, ON FOUR

2474
01:15:16,744 --> 01:15:19,848
OCCASIONS, I'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE

2475
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:20,381
OF THE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY LIKE

2476
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:22,50
OTHER PEOPLE.

2477
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:23,819
I'M NOT GOING TO NAME THEIR

2478
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,953
NAMES BECAUSE I WON'T EMBARRASS

2479
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,955
THEM BUT VIRTUALLY EVERY

2480
01:15:25,86 --> 01:15:27,989
PERSONAL YOU READ ABOUT ON THE

2481
01:15:27,88 --> 01:15:29,157
FRONT PAGE OF THE BUSINESS

2482
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:30,525
SECTIONS, THEY'VE USED THE LAW.

2483
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,993
THE DIFFERENCE IS WHEN SOMEBODY

2484
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:33,461
ELSE USES THE LAWS, NOBODY

2485
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:36,331
WRITES ABOUT IT.

2486
01:15:33,594 --> 01:15:39,167
WHEN I USE IT, THEY SAY TRUMP,

2487
01:15:36,464 --> 01:15:44,239
TRUMP, TRUMP.

2488
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:44,605
I BUILT A NET WORTH OF TENS OF

2489
01:15:44,372 --> 01:15:46,74
MILLIONS.

2490
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:46,441
I AM VERY PROUD OF THE JOB I

2491
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,943
DID.

2492
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:50,245
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DEALS.

2493
01:15:49,77 --> 01:15:52,113
FOUR TIMES I'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE

2494
01:15:50,378 --> 01:15:53,315
OF THE LAWS AND FRANKLY, SO HAS

2495
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,348
EVERYBODY ELSE IN MY POSITION.

2496
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:57,485
>> WELL, SIR, LET'S JUST TALK

2497
01:15:55,350 --> 01:16:00,55
ABOUT THE LATEST EXAMPLE WHICH

IS TRUMP ENTERTAINMENT RESORTS

2499
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:05,861
WHICH WENT BANKRUPT IN 2009.

2500
01:16:02,623 --> 01:16:09,63
IN THAT CASE ALONE, LENDERS TO

2501
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:10,565
YOUR COMPANY LOST OVER A BILLION

2502
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:12,33
DOLLARS AND MORE THAN 1,100

2503
01:16:10,698 --> 01:16:14,236
PEOPLE WERE LAID OFF.

2504
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,569
IS THAT THE WAY THAT YOU RUN THE

2505
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:16,571
COUNTRY?

2506
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:17,772

FIRST, THEY AREN'T BABIES.

01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:21,977
THESE ARE TOTAL KILLERS.

01:16:21,76 --> 01:16:22,878
THESE ARE NOT THE NICE SWEET

2511
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,144
PEOPLE THAT YOU THINK.

HOW DO YOU ANSWER TANYA?

2553
01:17:43,591 --> 01:17:46,394

LEADERS THAT RECOGNIZE THE

2555
01:17:46,527 --> 01:17:48,896
ECONOMY WE LIVE IN TODAY WAS

2556
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,498
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE

2557
01:17:49,30 --> 01:17:52,000
ONE WE HAD FIVE YEARS AGO.

2558
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:53,601
IT IS AN ECONOMY THAT HAS PLACED

2559
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:55,337
US IN GLOBAL COMPETITION WITH

2560
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:55,703
DOZENS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND

01:18:00,641 --> 01:18:02,110
THEM.

2566
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:03,144
THE SMAUM COMPANIES LIKE THE

01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:05,613
ONES SHE'S TALKING ABOUT,

2568
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:06,14
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE

2569
01:18:05,746 --> 01:18:07,282
STRUGGLING.

2570
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:09,117
WE NEED TO EVEN OUT THE TAX CODE

2571
01:18:07,415 --> 01:18:09,684

2574
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:16,191
BUSINESSES.

2575
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:17,959
WE NEED TO HAVE A REGULAR BUDGET

WE NEED TO REPEAL OBAMACARE AND

2579
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:26,34
WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO

01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:36,44
BUSINESSES AND SMALL BANKS.

2585
01:18:33,674 --> 01:18:38,279

2594
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:50,325
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS.

2595
01:18:48,656 --> 01:18:52,693
>> SENATOR RUBIO, THANK YOU.

2596
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:53,827
>> ANOTHER QUESTION FOR A FEW OF

2597
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:54,996
YOU.

2598
01:18:53,961 --> 01:18:55,30
YESTERDAY, JUST YERKSD PRESIDENT

2599
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:59,501
OBAMA CRITICIZED REPUBLICAN

2600
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:59,534
LAWMAKERS, TRYING TO BLOCK THE

2601
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:05,6
IRAN DEAL, CALLING THEM KNEE

2602
01:19:01,702 --> 01:19:05,40
JERK PARTISANS, ADDING THAT HARD

2603
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:10,145
LINERS IN IRAN WHO CHANT DEATH

2604
01:19:06,574 --> 01:19:11,646
TO AMERICA WERE, QUOTE, MAKING

2605
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:11,979
COMMON CAUSE WITH THE REPUBLICAN

2606
01:19:11,779 --> 01:19:13,448
CAUCUS.

2607
01:19:12,113 --> 01:19:15,816
HERE'S WHAT TWO OF YOUR

2608
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:17,252
OPPONENTS ON THE 5:00 P.M.

2609
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:19,954
DEBATE STAGE SAID ABOUT IRAN.

2610
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:21,89
>> I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING.

2611
01:19:20,88 --> 01:19:22,557
I WOULD RATHER HAVE CARLY

2612
01:19:21,222 --> 01:19:23,624
FIORINA OVER THERE DOING OUR

2613
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:24,959
NEGOTIATION THAN JOHN KERRY.

2614
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:26,94
MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A

2615
01:19:25,93 --> 01:19:26,928
DEAL WHERE WE DIDN'T GIVE

2616
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:30,532
EVERYTHING AWAY.

2617
01:19:27,62 --> 01:19:30,565
BUT THE ISSUE FOR US IS TO HAVE

2618
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:34,502
A CONGRESS THAT STANDS UP AND

2619
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:35,903
SAYS, NOT ONLY NO BUT HELL NO TO

2620
01:19:34,635 --> 01:19:37,638
THIS MONEY GOING TO A REGIME

2621
01:19:36,37 --> 01:19:37,972
THAT IS GOING TO USE IT FOR

2622
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:39,407
TERROR.

2623
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:41,242
>> WHEN AMERI DOES NOT LEAD,

2624
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:42,510
THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS AND A

2625
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:44,112
TRAGIC PLACE.

2626
01:19:42,643 --> 01:19:46,314
THIS IS A BAD DEAL.

2627
01:19:44,245 --> 01:19:47,14
OBAMA BROKE EVERY RULE OF

2628
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,684
NEGOTIATION.

2629
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:51,852
YES, OUR ALLIES ARE NOT PERFECT.

2630
01:19:49,817 --> 01:19:53,555
BUT IRAN IS AT THE HEART OF MOST

2631
01:19:51,986 --> 01:19:53,588
OF THE EVIL THAT IS GOING ON IN

2632
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:56,91
THE MIDDLE EAST THROUGH THEIR

2633
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:58,358
PROXY.

2634
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:58,659
>> I WANT TO ASK A FEW OF YOU

2635
01:19:58,493 --> 01:19:59,760
THIS.

2636
01:19:58,793 --> 01:20:00,995
FIRST GOVERNOR WALKER.

2637
01:19:59,894 --> 01:20:03,164
YOU'VE SAID THAT YOU WOULD TEAR

2638
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:06,767
UP THE IRAN DEAL ON DAY ONE.

2639
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:07,68
IF THIS DEAL IS UNDONE, WHAT

2640
01:20:06,901 --> 01:20:07,102
THEN?

2641
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:09,837
>> WELL, FIRST OFF, LET'S

2642
01:20:09,36 --> 01:20:12,307
REMEMBER.

2643
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:13,808
I REMEMBER AS A KID TYING A

2644
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:19,347
YELLOW RIBBON ON THE TREE IN

2645
01:20:13,941 --> 01:20:19,780
FRONT OF MY HOUSE DURING44

2646
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,916
DAYS.

2647
01:20:19,914 --> 01:20:22,282
IRAN IS NOT A PLACE DOING

2648
01:20:22,49 --> 01:20:23,951
BUSINESS.

2649
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,752
WITH YOU REINSTATE SANCTIONS

2650
01:20:24,85 --> 01:20:26,588
AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS.

2651
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:26,621
YOU GO TO CONGRESS AND PUT IN

2652
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:29,124
PLACE EVEN MORE CRIPPLING

2653
01:20:28,22 --> 01:20:30,625
SANCTIONS IN PLACE AND THEN YOU

2654
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:30,924
CONVINCE OUR ALLIES TO DO THE

2655
01:20:30,758 --> 01:20:32,559
SAME.

2656
01:20:31,58 --> 01:20:34,229
THIS IS NOT JUST BAD WITH IRAN.

2657
01:20:32,693 --> 01:20:36,331
THIS IS BAD WITH ISIS, IT IS

2658
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:37,665
TIED TOGETHER.

2659
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:38,766
ONCE FOR ALL, WE NEED A LEADER

2660
01:20:37,798 --> 01:20:39,367
WHO WILL STAND UP AND DOING SOME

2661
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:41,336
ABOUT IT.

2662
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:44,905
YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE

2663
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:47,108
FAILED FOREIGN POLICY OF THE

2664
01:20:45,39 --> 01:20:47,142
OBAMA-CLINTON DOCTRINE.

2665
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,843
>> SENATOR PAUL, WOULD YOU

2666
01:20:48,576 --> 01:20:51,346
OPPOSE IT?

2667
01:20:48,976 --> 01:20:52,213
>> I OPPOSED IT AND WILL VOTE

2668
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,181
AGAINST IT.

2669
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:54,849
I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT

2670
01:20:53,314 --> 01:20:56,451
NEGOTIATED FROM A POSITION OF

2671
01:20:54,982 --> 01:20:57,519
STRENGTH BUT I DON'T IMMEDIATELY

2672
01:20:56,584 --> 01:20:58,919
DISCOUNT NEGOTIATIONS.

2673
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:01,222
I'M A REAGAN CONSERVATIVE.

2674
01:20:59,53 --> 01:21:01,556
REAGAN DID NEGOTIATE WITH THE

2675
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,324
SOVIETS.

2676
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:05,460
BUT YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE FROM A

2677
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:06,460
POSITION OF STRENGTH AND I THINK

2678
01:21:05,593 --> 01:21:07,462
PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE AWAY TOO

2679
01:21:06,594 --> 01:21:08,929
MUCH TOO EARLY.

2680
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:10,898
IFHERE'S GOING TO BE A

2681
01:21:09,63 --> 01:21:12,700
NEGOTIATION, YOU'RE GOING TO

2682
01:21:11,32 --> 01:21:13,868
HAVE TO BELIEVE SOMEHOW THAT THE

2683
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:15,503
IRANIANS WILL COMPLY.

2684
01:21:14,1 --> 01:21:17,104
AND I ASKED THIS QUESTION TO

2685
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:19,72
JOHN KERRY.

2686
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:20,542
I SAID DO YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE

2687
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,941
TRUST WORTHY?

2688
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,877
NO.

2689
01:21:21,75 --> 01:21:25,12
HOW WILL WE GET THEM ON COMPLY?

2690
01:21:23,10 --> 01:21:26,247
I WOULD HAVE NEVER RELEASED THE

2691
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,748
SANCTIONS BEFORE THERE WAS

2692
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,149
CONSISTENT EVIDENCE OF

2693
01:21:27,882 --> 01:21:28,183
COMPLIANCE.

2694
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:30,985
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT

2695
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:33,20
SENATOR PAUL JUST SAID?

2696
01:21:31,118 --> 01:21:34,955
>> RONALD REAGAN SAID TRUST BY

2697
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:38,92
VERIFY.

2698
01:21:35,89 --> 01:21:38,859
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TRUST

2699
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:41,862
BUTVILLE FIVE.

2700
01:21:38,993 --> 01:21:42,397
HE VILLIFIES EVERYONE WHO

2701
01:21:41,996 --> 01:21:43,998
DISAGREES WITH HIM.

2702
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:45,833
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PARTY.

2703
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:47,1
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE INCREDIBLY

2704
01:21:45,966 --> 01:21:49,237
DANGEROUS PLACE THIS WORLD WILL

2705
01:21:47,134 --> 01:21:51,172
BE AS A RESULT OF A DEAL IN

2706
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:51,206
WHICH WE GOT NOTHING.

2707
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,708
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET FOUR HOSTAGES

2708
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:54,942
OUT.

2709
01:21:53,841 --> 01:21:57,412
WE GOT NOTHING.

2710
01:21:55,76 --> 01:21:57,712
AND IRAN GETS EVERYTHING THEY

2711
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:59,880
WANT.

2712
01:21:57,845 --> 01:22:02,217
WE SAID WE WOULD HAVE ANYWHERE

2713
01:22:00,14 --> 01:22:02,617
ANY TIME NEGOTIATION AND

2714
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,818
INSPECTIONS.

2715
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:07,54
WE GAVE THAT UP.

2716
01:22:03,951 --> 01:22:07,722
WOMEN THAT WE WOULD MAKE SURE

2717
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:09,990
THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY

2718
01:22:07,855 --> 01:22:10,258
NUCLEAR CAPACITY, WE GAVE THAT

2719
01:22:10,124 --> 01:22:11,392
UP.

2720
01:22:10,391 --> 01:22:12,427
THE PRESIDENT CAN'T TELL US WHAT

2721
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:13,695
WE GOT.

2722
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,728
I'LL TELL WHAT YOU THE WORLD

2723
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:15,663
GOT.

2724
01:22:14,95 --> 01:22:17,832
THE WORLD HAS A BURGEONING

2725
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:20,201
NUCLEAR POWER THAT DIDN'T, AS

2726
01:22:17,965 --> 01:22:20,235
THE SOVIETS SAY WE MIGHT DEFEND

2727
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:23,738
OURSELVES IN A WAR.

2728
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:26,274
BUT THE IRANIANS HAD SAID, WE

2729
01:22:23,871 --> 01:22:27,808
WILL WIPE ISRAEL OFF THE FACE OF

2730
01:22:26,407 --> 01:22:28,743
THE MAP AND WE WILL BRING DEATH

2731
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:30,245
TO AMERICA.

2732
01:22:28,876 --> 01:22:31,979
WHEN SOMEONE POINTS A GUN AT

2733
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:33,748
YOUR HEAD AND LOADS IT, BY GOD

2734
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,115
YOU OUGHT TO TAKE THEM

2735
01:22:33,881 --> 01:22:35,383
SERIOUSLY.

2736
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:35,750
AND WE NEED TO TAKE THAT

2737
01:22:35,516 --> 01:22:39,519
SERIOUSLY.

2738
01:22:35,883 --> 01:22:43,424
>> THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.

2739
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:44,692
>> THE FIRST DEBATE NIGHT OF THE

2740
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:45,593
2015 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

01:22:44,825 --> 01:23:01,608
CONTINUES FROM CLEVELAND AFTER A

2742

SH

2743
01:23:01,742 --> 01:23:04,845
>>> WE'RE MOVING ON TO DISCUSS

2744
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:06,514
SOCIAL ISSUES.

2745
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:06,781
GOVERNOR BUSH, LET'S START WITH

2746
01:23:06,647 --> 01:23:08,149
YOU.

2747
01:23:06,914 --> 01:23:10,818
MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN

2748
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:12,253
OUTRAGED RECENTLY BY A SERIES OF

2749
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:14,355
VIDEOS ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

2750
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:15,755
YOU NOW SAY YOU WOULD END

2751
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:17,459
FUNDING FOR THIS ORGANIZATION.

2752
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,759
HOWEVER, UNTIL LAY 2014, RIGHT

2753
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:21,129
BEFORE YOU STARTED YOUR XANL,

2754
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:23,298
YOU SAT ON THE BOARD OF A

2755
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:25,599
BLOOMBERG CHARITY THAT QUITE

2756
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:26,567
PUBLICLY GAVE TENS OF MILLIONS

2757
01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:26,601
OF DOLLARS TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD

2758
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:31,806
WHILE YOU WERE A DIRECTOR.

2759
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:33,540
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW ABOUT THESE

2760
01:23:31,939 --> 01:23:35,610
AND IF YOU DID KNOW, HOW CAN YOU

2761
01:23:33,674 --> 01:23:36,544
HELP A CHARITY SO OPENLY

2762
01:23:35,743 --> 01:23:39,180
COMMITTED TO ABORTION RIGHTS.

2763
01:23:36,677 --> 01:23:40,482
>> I JOINED BECAUSE OF MIKE

2764
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:42,150
BLOOMBERG'S SHARED COMMITMENT

2765
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:43,684
FOR MEANINGFUL EDUCATION REFORM.

2766
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:45,620
THAT'S WHY I WAS ON IT.

2767
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,953
WE NEVER HAD A DEBATE ABOUT THE

2768
01:23:45,753 --> 01:23:47,655
BUDGET.

2769
01:23:46,87 --> 01:23:47,922
IT WAS PRESENTED AND WE APPROVED

2770
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:49,424
IT.

2771
01:23:48,55 --> 01:23:50,358
NOT ITEM BY ITEM.

2772
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:52,227
HERE'S MY RECORD.

2773
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,894
AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF

2774
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,295
FLORIDA, I DEFUNDED PLANNED

2775
01:23:54,28 --> 01:23:56,864
PARENTHOOD.

2776
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:57,599
I CREATED A CULTURE OF LIFE IN

2777
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:57,632
OUR STATE.

2778
01:23:57,732 --> 01:24:03,505
WE WERE THE ONLY STATE TO

2779
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:04,606
APPROPRIATE MONEY FOR CRISIS

2780
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:04,639
PREGNANCY CENTERS.

2781
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:07,407
WE EXPAND DRAMATICALLY THE

2782
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,808
NUMBER ADOPTIONS OUT OF OUR

2783
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,145
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM.

2784
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:10,545
WE DID PARENTAL NOTIFICATION

2785
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:12,247
LAWS.

2786
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:14,482
WE ENDED PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION.

2787
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:16,951
WE DID ALL OF THIS AND WE WERE

2788
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:19,86
THE FIRST STATE TO DO A CHOOSE

2789
01:24:17,84 --> 01:24:22,322
LIFE LICENSE PLATE.

2790
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:23,791
NOW 29 STATES HAVE DONE IT AND

2791
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:24,559
THERE'S A CULTURE WHERE MORE

2792
01:24:23,924 --> 01:24:25,326
CHILDREN ARE DOCUMENTED.

2793
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,227
>> DID YOU KNOW?

2794
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,228
>> NO.

2795
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:28,229
I DIDN'T KNOW.

2796
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,364
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

2797
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,298
I WAS WORKING ON THE BOARD

2798
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:31,199
BECAUSE OF EDUCATION.

2799
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:33,67
MY RECORD IS CLEAR.

2800
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:35,270
MY RECORD AS A PRO-LIFE GOVERNOR

2801
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:36,538
IS NOT IN DISPUTE.

2802
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:38,173
I AM COMPLETELY PRO-LIFE AND I

2803
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:40,41
BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE A CULTURE

2804
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:41,543
OF LIFE THAT IS INFORMED BY MY

2805
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:43,211
FAITH FROM BEGINNING TO END.

2806
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:44,512
DID I THIS NOT JUST AS IT

2807
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,946
RELATED TO UNBORN BABIES.

2808
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:46,246
AT THE END OF LIFE ISSUES AS

2809
01:24:46,80 --> 01:24:47,649
WELL.

2810
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,682
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GOES WAY

2811
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:50,918
BEYOND POLITICS.

2812
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:52,253
I HOPE ONE DAY WE GET TO THE

2813
01:24:51,52 --> 01:24:55,290
POINT WHERE WE RESPECT LIFE IN

2814
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:55,590
ITS FULLEST FORM ACROSS THE

2815
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:58,358
BOARD.

2816
01:24:55,723 --> 01:25:02,497
>> SENATOR RUBIO, YOU FAVOR A

2817
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:03,364
RAPE AND INCEST EXCEPTION TO

2818
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:05,600
ABORTION BANS.

2819
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:07,735
CARDINAL DOLAN YESTERDAY SAID

2820
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:08,169
THOSE EXCEPTIONS ARE

2821
01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:08,203
PREPOSTEROUS.

2822
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:11,806
HE SAID THEY DISCRIMINATE

2823
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:12,139
AGAINST AN ENTIRE CLASS OF HUMAN

2824
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:14,442
BEINGS.

2825
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:15,577
IF YOU BEGIN THAT LIFE BEGINS AT

2826
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:17,512
NCEPTION, HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY

2827
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:19,447
ENDING A LIFE JUST BECAUSE IT

2828
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:20,181
BEGINS VIOLENTLY THROUGH NO

2829
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:20,215
FAULT OF THE BABY?

2830
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:22,883
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S A

2831
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,218
CORRECTED ASSESSMENT OF MY

2832
01:25:23,17 --> 01:25:24,985
RECORD.

2833
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,454
I WOULD GO ON TO ADD --

2834
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:28,22
>> YOU DON'T FAVOR --

2835
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:30,157
>> I HAVE NEVER SAID THAT.

2836
01:25:28,155 --> 01:25:31,826
AND I HAVE NEVER ADVOCATED THAT.

2837
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,628
I HAVE ADVOCATED THAT WE PASS A

2838
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:35,29
LAW THAT SAYS ALL HUMAN LIFE AT

2839
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,231
EVERY STAGE OF DEVELOP MANY IS

2840
01:25:35,162 --> 01:25:37,632
WORTHY OF PROTECTION.

2841
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:39,666
I THINK THAT LAW EXISTS.

2842
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:40,401
IT IS CALLED THE CONSTITUTION OF

2843
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,937
THE UNITED STATES.

2844
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:45,5
AND LET ME GO FURTHER.

2845
01:25:43,37 --> 01:25:45,773
I BELIEVE THAT EVERY SINGLE

2846
01:25:45,139 --> 01:25:47,808
HUMAN BEING IS IN ENTITLED TO

2847
01:25:45,906 --> 01:25:49,410
THE PROTECTION OF OUR LAWS,

2848
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:51,45
WHETHER THEY CAN VOTE OR NOT.

2849
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:52,179
WHETHER THEY CAN SPEAK OR NOT.

2850
01:25:51,178 --> 01:25:52,680
WHETHER THEY CAN HIRE A LAWYER

2851
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:53,914
OR NOT.

2852
01:25:52,813 --> 01:25:54,682
WHETHER THEY HAVE A BIRTH

2853
01:25:54,48 --> 01:25:55,683
CERTIFICATE OR NOT.

2854
01:25:54,815 --> 01:25:57,117
I THINK FUTURE GENERATION

2855
01:25:55,816 --> 01:25:58,385
THERE'S LOOK BACK AT THIS

2856
01:25:57,252 --> 01:26:01,489
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND CALL

2857
01:25:58,519 --> 01:26:02,890
US BARBARIANS FOR MURDERING

2858
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:04,491
MILLIONS OF BABIES WHO WE NEVER

2859
01:26:03,23 --> 01:26:05,926
GAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE.

2860
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:07,962
>> MR. TRUMP?

2861
01:26:06,60 --> 01:26:09,564
IN 1999, YOU SAID YOU WERE,

2862
01:26:08,95 --> 01:26:11,966
QUOTE, VERY PRO-CHOICE.

2863
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:12,333
EVEN SUPPORTING PARTIAL-BIRTH

2864
01:26:12,99 --> 01:26:14,1
ABORTION.

2865
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,768
YOU FAVORED AN ASSAULT WEAPONS

2866
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:16,337
BAN AS WELL.

2867
01:26:14,902 --> 01:26:18,573
IN 2004 YOU SAID IN MOST CASES

2868
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:19,940
YOU IDENTIFIED AS A DEMOCRAT.

2869
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:21,309
EVEN IN THIS CAMPAIGN YOUR

2870
01:26:20,74 --> 01:26:22,677
CRITICS SAY YOU OFTEN SOUND MORE

2871
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,944
LIKE A DEMOCRAT THAN A

2872
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,45
REPUBLICAN, CALLING SEVERAL OF

2873
01:26:24,78 --> 01:26:26,914
YOUR OPPONENTS ON THE STAGE

2874
01:26:25,179 --> 01:26:27,682
THINGS LIKE CLOWNS AND PUPPETS.

2875
01:26:27,47 --> 01:26:34,789
WHEN DID YOU ACTUALLY BECOME A

2876
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:36,290
REPUBLICAN?

2877
01:26:34,922 --> 01:26:37,458
>> I DON'T THINK THEY LIKE ME

2878
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,426
VERY MUCH.

2879
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:40,327
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

2880
01:26:38,559 --> 01:26:41,28
I'VE EVOLVED ON MANY ISSUES OVER

2881
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:42,497
THE YEARS.

2882
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:44,699
DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE HAS?

2883
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:45,166
RONALD REAGAN EVOLVED ON MANY

2884
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,467
ISSUES.

2885
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,135
AND I AM PRO-LIFE.

2886
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:48,902
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE QUESTION,

2887
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:51,673
I WAS IN BUSINESS.

2888
01:26:49,36 --> 01:26:53,40
THEY ASKED ME A QUESTION AS TO

2889
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:55,543
PRO-LIFE OR CHOICE.

2890
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:57,545
AND I SAID IF YOU LET IT RUN,

2891
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:58,77
THAT I HATE THE CONCEPT OF

2892
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,315
ABORTION.

2893
01:26:58,212 --> 01:27:03,785
I HATE THE CONCEPT OF ABORTION.

2894
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:03,818
AND THEN SINCE THEN, I'VE VECHD

2895
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:05,486
EVOLVED.

2896
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:09,223
AND WT HAPPENED WAS FRIENDS OF

2897
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:10,24
MINE YEARS AGO WERE GOING TO

2898
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,58
HAVE A CHILD AND IT WAS GOING TO

2899
01:27:10,157 --> 01:27:11,892
BE ABORTED.

2900
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:13,628
AND WASN'T ABORTED.

2901
01:27:12,26 --> 01:27:14,562
AND THAT CHILD TODAY IS A TOTAL

2902
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:14,629
SUPER STAR.

2903
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:17,64
A GREAT, GREAT CHILD.

2904
01:27:16,96 --> 01:27:19,133
AND I SAW THAT.

2905
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,868
AND I SAW OTHER INSTANCES.

2906
01:27:19,266 --> 01:27:22,503
AND I AM VERY, VERY PROUD TO SAY

2907
01:27:21,1 --> 01:27:23,904
THAT I AM PRO-LIFE.

2908
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:25,773
AS FAR AS BEING A REPUBLICAN IS

2909
01:27:24,38 --> 01:27:27,607
CONCERNED, I COME FROM A PLACE,

2910
01:27:25,906 --> 01:27:31,45
NEW YORK CITY, WHICH IS

2911
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:32,613
VIRTUALLY, I MEAN, IT IS ALMOST

2912
01:27:31,178 --> 01:27:34,582
EXCLUSIVELY DEMOCRAT.

2913
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:36,917
AND I HAVE REALLY STARTED TO

2914
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:38,720
SEE, SOME OF THE NEGATIVES AS AN

2915
01:27:37,51 --> 01:27:40,54
EXAMPLE, AND I HAVE A LOT OF

2916
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:43,123
LIKING FOR THIS MAN, BUT THE

2917
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:44,157
LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS OF HIS

2918
01:27:43,257 --> 01:27:44,558
BROTHER'S ADMINISTRATION WERE A

2919
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:47,328
CATASTROPHE.

2920
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:47,362
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE FEW

2921
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:49,96
MONTHS GAVE US PRESIDENT OBAMA.

2922
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:52,433
AND YOU CAN'T BE HAPPY ABOUT

2923
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:54,468
THAT.

2924
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:56,36
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, ON THE

2925
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:57,137
SUBJECT OF NAME CALLING O YOUR

2926
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:58,806
FELLOW CANDIDATES, A STORY

2927
01:27:57,271 --> 01:28:01,41
APPEARED TODAY QUOTING AN

2928
01:27:58,939 --> 01:28:03,244
ANONYMOUS DONOR WHO SAID YOU

2929
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:03,944
CALLED MR. TRUMP, A CLOWN, A

2930
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:05,279
BUFFOON, SOMETHING ELSE THAT

2931
01:28:04,78 --> 01:28:06,447
CANNOT REPEATED ON TELEVISION.

2932
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:07,647
>> NONE OF WHICH IS TRUE.

2933
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:08,483
>> IS IT TRUE?

2934
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,50
>> NO.

2935
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:11,151
BUT I HAVE PMD MR. TRUMP'S

2936
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:12,219
LANGUAGE IS DIVISIVE.

2937
01:28:11,285 --> 01:28:13,821
I WANT TO WIN.

2938
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:16,424
I WANT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE HERE

2939
01:28:13,954 --> 01:28:17,258
OR THE ONES AT 5:00, TO BE THE

2940
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:17,592
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

2941
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,527
STATES.

2942
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:21,362
WE'RE NOT GOING ON WIN BY DOING

2943
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:21,396
THE BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY

2944
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:24,632
CLINTON DO EACH AND EVERY DAY.

2945
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:26,165
DIVIDING THE COUNTRY.

2946
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,567
SAYING, CREATING A GRIEVANCE

2947
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,102
ENVIRONMENT.

2948
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:30,638
WE'RE GOING ON WIN WHEN WE UNITE

2949
01:28:28,235 --> 01:28:31,572
PEOPLE WITH A HOPEFUL,

2950
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:32,306
OPTIMISTIC MESSAGE.

2951
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:33,775
THAT I HAVE MESSAGE BECAUSE I

2952
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,442
WAS A GOVERNOR OF A STATE THAT

2953
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:36,911
SAW PEOPLE LIFTED UP.

2954
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:37,244
WE HAD HIGH SUSTAINED ECONOMIC

2955
01:28:37,44 --> 01:28:38,946
GROWTH.

2956
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:40,447
OUR ECONOMY GREW AT DOUBLE THE

2957
01:28:39,79 --> 01:28:43,384
RATE OF THE NATION.

2958
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:43,418
WE CREATED 1.3 MILLION JOBS.

2959
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:45,386
WE LED THE NATION SEVEN OUT OF

2960
01:28:44,685 --> 01:28:45,420
THE EIGHT YEARS.

2961
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:51,91
WE WERE ONLY ONE OF TWO STATES

2962
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:53,661
THAT WENT TO AAA BOND RATING I

2963
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:55,797
CUT TAXES, $19 BILLION.

2964
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:59,500
IF YOU DO THAT THE RIGHT WAY,

2965
01:28:55,930 --> 01:29:00,367
YOU CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

2966
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:01,569
EVERYBODY COMES UP.

2967
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:02,870
TO GIVE PEOPLE HOPE THAT THEIR

2968
01:29:01,702 --> 01:29:04,772
LIFE IS BETTER BECAUSE TOO MANY

2969
01:29:03,3 --> 01:29:06,5
PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING IN AMERICA.

2970
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:09,443
>> 30 SECONDS.

2971
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:10,678
>> FIRST OF ALL, I AM VERY HAPPY

2972
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:11,412
THAT YOU DENIED THAT AND I

2973
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:11,446
APPRECIATE THAT VEX.

2974
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:13,180
HE IS A TRUE GENTLEMAN.

2975
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,849
HE REALLY IS.

2976
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:16,150
ONE THING HE DID SAY, AND I MEAN

2977
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:17,852
THAT.

2978
01:29:16,283 --> 01:29:19,520
THE ONE THING HE DID SAY ABOUT

2979
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:21,556
ME WAS MY TONE.

2980
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:23,491
AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT.

2981
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:25,92
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT

2982
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:26,894
ARE CUTTING CHRISTIANS' HEADS

2983
01:29:25,225 --> 01:29:28,863
OFF, WHEN YOU HAVE A WORLD THAT

2984
01:29:27,27 --> 01:29:30,765
THE BORDER AND AT SO MANY

2985
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:36,871
PLACES, THAT IT IS MEDIEVAL

2986
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:39,6
TIMES, WE'VE NEVER -- IT ALMOST

2987
01:29:37,4 --> 01:29:40,575
HAS TO BE BAD AS IT WAS.

2988
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:42,109
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR TONE.

2989
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,409
WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND GET JOB

2990
01:29:42,242 --> 01:29:44,479
DONE.

2991
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:46,213
>> THE SUBJECT OF GAY MARRIAGE

2992
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:47,348
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

2993
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:49,215
GOVERNOR KASICH, IF YOU HAD A

2994
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:50,250
SON OR DAUGHTER WHO WAS GAY OR

2995
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:53,120
LESBIAN, HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN

2996
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:54,88
TO THEM YOUR OPPOSITION TO

2997
01:29:53,253 --> 01:29:55,456
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE?

2998
01:29:54,221 --> 01:29:55,490
>> I'M AN OLD-FASHIONED PERSON

2999
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:58,759
HERE AND I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN

3000
01:29:58,125 --> 01:29:59,594
TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE.

3001
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:02,763
I'VE ALSO.

3002
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:04,398
THE COURT HAS RULED --

3003
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,399
>> WOULD YOU WOULD YOU -- HOW

3004
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:08,636
WOULD YOU EXPLAIN IT?

3005
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:08,936
>> I'VE SAID THE COURT HAS

3006
01:30:08,769 --> 01:30:10,872
RULED.

3007
01:30:09,69 --> 01:30:13,173
I JUST WENT TO A WEDDING OF A

3008
01:30:11,5 --> 01:30:13,440
FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAPPENS TO BE

3009
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:14,375
GAY.

3010
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:17,311
BECAUSE SOMEBODY DOESN'T THINK

3011
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:18,45
THE WAY I DO, DOESN'T MEAN I

3012
01:30:17,444 --> 01:30:18,345
CAN'T CARE ABOUT THEM OR LOVE

3013
01:30:18,178 --> 01:30:19,514
THEM.

3014
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:20,848
IF ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS HAPPENED

3015
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:22,182
TO BE THERE, OF COURSE I WOULD

3016
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:23,50
LOVE THEM AND ACCEPT THEM.

3017
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:25,686
YOU KNOW WHAT?

3018
01:30:23,183 --> 01:30:29,456
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TAUGHT WHEN WE

3019
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:32,159
HAVE STRONG FAITH.

3020
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:34,28
SO ISSUES LIKE THAT, ISSUES LIKE

3021
01:30:32,292 --> 01:30:35,530
THAT ARE PLANTED TO DIVIDE US.

3022
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:36,964
I THINK THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE

3023
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:38,566
MATTER IS, THIS IS WHERE I WOULD

3024
01:30:37,97 --> 01:30:39,433
AGREE WITH JEB AND I'VE BEEN

3025
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:41,468
SAYING IT ALL ALONG.

3026
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:42,737
WE NEED TO GIVE EVERYBODY A

3027
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:44,672
CHANCE, TREAT EVERYBODY WITH

3028
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:46,707
RESPECT, AND LET THEM SHARE IN

3029
01:30:44,805 --> 01:30:47,575
THIS GREAT AMERICAN DREAM THAT

3030
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:49,209
WE HAVE, MEGYN.

3031
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:51,812
I'M GOING TO LOVE MY DAUGHTERS.

3032
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:52,479
I'M GOING TO LOVE THEM NO MATTER

3033
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,147
WHAT THEY DO.

3034
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,882
YOU KNOW WHAT?

3035
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,517
GOD GIVES ME UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.

3036
01:30:55,16 --> 01:30:56,550
I'M GOING TO GIVE TO IT MY

3037
01:30:56,651 --> 01:31:02,156
FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS AND THE

3038
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,490
PEOPLE AROUND ME.

3039
01:31:02,289 --> 01:31:04,992
>> SENATOR PAUL.

3040
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:06,994
IN THE WAKE OF THE SUPREME COURT

3041
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:08,395
RULING ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE,

3042
01:31:07,127 --> 01:31:09,564
CAROL FOX ON FACEBOOK WANTS TO

3043
01:31:08,529 --> 01:31:09,864
KNOW THE FOLLOWING.

3044
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,566
QUOTE.

3045
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:12,633
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ENSURE

3046
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:14,602
CHRISTIANS ARE NOT PROSECUTED

3047
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:14,969
FOR SPEAKING OUT AGAINST GAY

3048
01:31:14,735 --> 01:31:16,571
MARRIAGE?

3049
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:18,138
AND WILL CHRISTIANS BE FORCED TO

3050
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:20,174
CONDUCT BUSINESS THAT CONFLICTS

3051
01:31:18,272 --> 01:31:22,843
WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS?

3052
01:31:20,307 --> 01:31:24,211
>> LOOK, I DON'T WANT MY

3053
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:29,617
MARRIAGE OR MY GUNS REGISTERED

3054
01:31:24,344 --> 01:31:33,554
IN WASHINGTON.

3055
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:33,588
IF PEOPLE HAVE AN OPINION, A

3056
01:31:33,688 --> 01:31:34,589
RELIGIOUS OPINION THAT IS

3057
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:37,692
HEARTILY FELT, THEY SHOULD BE

3058
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:40,394
ALLOWED TO PRACTICE THAT AND NO

3059
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:40,827
GOVERNMENT SHOULD INTERFERE WITH

3060
01:31:40,527 --> 01:31:42,262
THEM.

3061
01:31:40,962 --> 01:31:44,966
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY

3062
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:45,933
GOT TO ME WAS THE THING IN

3063
01:31:45,99 --> 01:31:47,401
HOUSTON WHERE YOU HAD THE

3064
01:31:46,67 --> 01:31:50,537
GOVERNMENT, THE MAYOR, ACTUALLY

3065
01:31:47,534 --> 01:31:50,905
TRYING TO GET THE SERMONS OF

3066
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:52,172
MINISTERS.

3067
01:31:51,38 --> 01:31:54,441
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TRIES TO

3068
01:31:52,306 --> 01:31:55,710
INVADE THE CHURCH TO ENFORCE ITS

3069
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:59,981
OWN OPINION ON MARRIAGE, THAT'S

3070
01:31:55,843 --> 01:32:03,250
WHEN IT IS TIME TO RESIST.

3071
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:05,620
>> GOVERNOR WALKER?

3072
01:32:03,383 --> 01:32:08,121
MANY IN THE BLACK LIVES MATTER

3073
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:09,156
MOVEMENT AND BEYOND BELIEVE THAT

3074
01:32:08,255 --> 01:32:10,758
OVERLY AGGRESSIVE POLICE

3075
01:32:09,289 --> 01:32:11,525
OFFICERS TARGETING YOUNG

3076
01:32:10,891 --> 01:32:14,161
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IS THE CIVIL

3077
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:14,728
RIGHTS ISSUE OF OUR TIME.

3078
01:32:14,294 --> 01:32:16,731
DO YOU AGREE?

3079
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,197
IF SO, HOW DO YOU PLAN TO

3080
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,799
ADDRESS IT?

3081
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:21,201
IF SO, WHY NOT?

3082
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:22,302
>> WELL, I THINK THE MOST

3083
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:23,604
IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO WHEN

3084
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:23,638
IT COMES TO POLICING IS

3085
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:24,639
SOMETHING YOU'VE HAD A GUEST ON,

3086
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,607
A FRIEND OF MINE, MILWAUKEE

01:32:26,674 --> 01:32:27,642
COUNTY SHERIFF DAVID CLARK WHO

3088
01:32:27,742 --> 01:32:30,310
HAS TALKED TO ME MANY TIMES

3089
01:32:29,76 --> 01:32:31,846
ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST.

3090
01:32:30,444 --> 01:32:34,115
IT IS ABOUT TRAINING.

3091
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:34,148
MAKING SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

3092
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:37,250
PROFESSIONALS, NOT ONLY ON THE

3093
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:38,452
WAY IN BUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH

THEIR TIME HAVE THE PROPER

3095
01:32:38,585 --> 01:32:40,87
TRAINING.

3096
01:32:39,53 --> 01:32:40,788
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO

3097
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:42,156
USE OF FORCE.

3098
01:32:40,921 --> 01:32:43,824
THAT WE PROTECT AND STAND UP AND

3099
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:44,959
SUPPORT THOSE MEN AND WOMEN

3100
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,358

ENFORCEMENT.

3102
01:32:45,492 --> 01:32:47,995
FOR THE VERY FEW THAT DON'T,

3103
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:50,164
THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO

3104
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:52,933
SHOW THAT WE TREAT EVERYONE THE

3105
01:32:50,297 --> 01:32:55,268

COMING UP.

3113
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:25,332
>>> WELCOME BACK TO CLEVELAND.

OUR NEXT TOP SIC FOREIGN POLICY.

3115

CANDIDATES, YOU MAY NOT HAVE

01:33:26,801 --> 01:33:29,804
SEEN THE LATE DEVELOPING NEWS

3117
01:33:29,469 --> 01:33:31,271
TODAY.

3118
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:33,473
OUR FOX PENTAGON TEAM BROKE

3119
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:34,875
EARLIER THIS EVENING ABOUT A TOP

3120
01:33:33,607 --> 01:33:37,44
IRANIAN GENERAL TRAVELING TO

3121
01:33:35,9 --> 01:33:40,781
MOSCOW TO MEET WITH RUSSIAN

3122
01:33:37,178 --> 01:33:43,349
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN.

3123
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:45,252
HIS NAME IS GENERAL.

3124
01:33:43,483 --> 01:33:46,520
HE IS BLAMED FOR HUNDREDS OF

3125
01:33:45,385 --> 01:33:48,655
DEATHS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.

3126
01:33:46,653 --> 01:33:52,893
HIS TRIP TO RUSSIA APPEARS TO

3127
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:53,492
DIRECTLY VIOLATE U.N. SKOINLS

3128
01:33:53,27 --> 01:33:55,629
RESOLUTIONS.

3129
01:33:53,627 --> 01:33:57,998
TO CONFINE HIM TO IRAN.

3130
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:58,899
MR. TRUMP, IF YOU WERE

3131
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,000
PRESIDENT, HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND

3132
01:33:59,33 --> 01:34:01,802
TO THIS?

3133
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:03,470
>> I WOULD BE SO DIFFERENT FROM

3134
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:06,139
WHAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW.

3135
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:08,209
LIKE THE POLAR OPPOSITE.

3136
01:34:06,273 --> 01:34:08,242
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T

3137
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:11,277
HAVE A CLUE.

3138
01:34:10,177 --> 01:34:12,45
I WOULD SAY HE IS INCOMPETENT

3139
01:34:11,411 --> 01:34:19,920
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

3140
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:21,288
THAT'S NOT NICE.

3141
01:34:20,54 --> 01:34:22,456
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEALS WE

3142
01:34:21,421 --> 01:34:23,858
MAKE, WHETHER THE NUCLEAR DEAL

3143
01:34:22,589 --> 01:34:25,392
WITH 24-HOUR PERIODS.

3144
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:28,462
BEFORE YOU GET TO THE 24 HOURS,

3145
01:34:25,525 --> 01:34:30,563
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A SYSTEM.

3146
01:34:28,595 --> 01:34:32,499
YOU LOOK AT SERGEANT BERGDAHL.

3147
01:34:30,697 --> 01:34:35,636
WE GET A TRAITOR AND THEY GET

3148
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:36,837
VE OF THE BIG GREAT KILLERS'

3149
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:38,239
LEADERS THAT THEY WANT.

3150
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:38,272
WE HAVE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON

3151
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:41,242
THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

3152
01:34:41,75 --> 01:34:41,275
DOING.

3153
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:47,848
NOW --

3154
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:49,884
>> I AGREE.

3155
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:51,385
WITH IRAN, WE'RE MAKING A DEAL.

3156
01:34:50,17 --> 01:34:52,787
YOU SAY, WE WANT HIM.

3157
01:34:51,518 --> 01:34:54,21
WE WANT OUR PRISONERS.

3158
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,289
WE WANT ALL THESE THINGS.

3159
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:57,591
WE DON'T GET ANYTHING.

3160
01:34:55,422 --> 01:34:58,759
WE'RE GIVING $150 BILLION PLUS.

3161
01:34:57,724 --> 01:34:58,793
THEY ARE GOING TO BE -- I'LL

3162
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:01,862
TELL YOU WHAT.

3163
01:35:00,294 --> 01:35:03,998
IF IRAN WAS THE STOCK, YOU FOLKS

3164
01:35:01,996 --> 01:35:04,265
SHOULD GO OUT AND BUY IT RIGHT

3165
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:04,298
NOW.

3166
01:35:04,398 --> 01:35:06,667
YOU'LL QUADRUPLE.

3167
01:35:05,699 --> 01:35:07,500
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAN IS

3168
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:10,70
A DISGRACE.

3169
01:35:07,634 --> 01:35:10,838
AND IT IS GOING TO LEAD TO

3170
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:13,808
DESTRUCTION IN LARGE PORTIONS OF

3171
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:17,76
THE WORLD.

3172
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:17,376
>> ANOTHER NEW DEVELOP MANY

3173
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,313
TODAY.

3174
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:20,247
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIALS TELL

3175
01:35:19,446 --> 01:35:22,82
FOX, THEY STRONGLY SUSPECT

3176
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:23,317
RUSSIA WAS BEHIND THE CYBER

3177
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:24,251
ATTACK ON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

3178
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:26,420
JOINT CHIEFS E-MAIL.

3179
01:35:24,384 --> 01:35:27,454
THIS COMES IN THE WAKE OF THE

3180
01:35:26,553 --> 01:35:28,488
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

3181
01:35:27,587 --> 01:35:30,925
INTELLIGENCE, BLAMING THE

3182
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:32,860
CHINESE FOR THE LARGEST EVER

3183
01:35:31,58 --> 01:35:35,262
CYBER ATTACK, STEALING PERSONAL

3184
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:35,963
DATA OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF

3185
01:35:35,395 --> 01:35:39,300
AMERICANS.

3186
01:35:36,96 --> 01:35:39,333
SENATOR CRUZ, IN YOUR VIEW, HAVE

3187
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,936
RUSSIA AND CHINA COMMITTED ACTS

3188
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:42,902
OF CYBER WAR?

3189
01:35:42,69 --> 01:35:44,138
IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT, WHAT

3190
01:35:43,37 --> 01:35:45,906
WOULD YOU DO ABOUT IT?

3191
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:48,175
>> WELL, OF COURSE THEY HAVE.

3192
01:35:46,40 --> 01:35:50,777
AND OVER THE LAST SIX AND A HALF

3193
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:52,213
YEARS, WE'VE SUSTAIN SQUENLSS OF

3194
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,679
THE OBAMA-CLINTON FOREIGN

3195
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:55,49
POLICY.

3196
01:35:52,813 --> 01:35:55,549
LEADING FROM BEHIND IS A

3197
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:57,351
CANDIDATE.

3198
01:35:55,682 --> 01:35:58,552
WE HAVE ABANDONED AND ALIENATED

3199
01:35:57,484 --> 01:36:01,555
OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES.

3200
01:35:58,685 --> 01:36:03,423
AND OUR ENEMIES ARE STRONGER.

3201
01:36:01,688 --> 01:36:05,926
RADICAL ISLAM IS ON THE RISE.

3202
01:36:03,557 --> 01:36:10,397
IRAN IS ON THE VERGE OF

3203
01:36:06,60 --> 01:36:10,630
ACQUIRING A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

3204
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:13,700
.

3205
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:19,39
RUSSIA, THE GENERAL, THE IRANIAN

3206
01:36:13,834 --> 01:36:19,406
GENERAL IS THE HEAD OF THE QUDS

3207
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:23,344
FORCES.

3208
01:36:19,539 --> 01:36:23,376
PART OF THIS IRANIAN DEAL WAS

3209
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:26,146
LIFTING THE INTERNATIONAL

3210
01:36:24,144 --> 01:36:27,781
SANCTIONS ON GENERAL SULEMANI.

3211
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:30,284
THE DAY HE FLEW BACK FROM MOSCOW

3212
01:36:27,915 --> 01:36:34,121
TO IRAN WAS THE DAY WE BELIEVE

3213
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:34,755
THAT RUSSIA USED CYBER WARFARE

3214
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:37,258
AGAINST THE JOINT CHIEFS.

3215
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:39,193
WE NEED A NEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF

3216
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:40,559
THAT WILL STAND UP TO OUR

3217
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:44,932
ENEMIES AND HAVE CREDIBILITY.

3218
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:47,902
IT IS WORTH EMPHASIZING THAT

3219
01:36:45,65 --> 01:36:48,668
IRAN RELEASED OUR HOSTAGES IN

3220
01:36:48,35 --> 01:36:56,510
1981, THE DAY RONALD REAGAN WAS

3221
01:36:48,802 --> 01:36:59,13
SWORN INTO OFFICE.

3222
01:36:56,643 --> 01:37:00,447
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA DECLARED IF

3223
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:01,748
SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD USED

3224
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,716
CHEMICAL WEAPONS, THAT'S A RED

3225
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:04,351
LINE FOR US.

3226
01:37:02,849 --> 01:37:04,785
THAT THERE WOULD BE ENORMOUS

3227
01:37:04,484 --> 01:37:06,486
CONSEQUENCES.

3228
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:08,956
ONE YEAR LATER WITH OVERWHELMING

3229
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:10,190
EVIDENCE THAT ASSAD HAD IN FACT

3230
01:37:09,89 --> 01:37:11,725
USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND

3231
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:13,660
CROSSED THAT RED LINE, PRESIDENT

3232
01:37:11,858 --> 01:37:15,762
OBAMA DECLINED TO USE MILITARY

3233
01:37:13,794 --> 01:37:16,897
FORCE AGAINST THE ASSAD REGIME.

3234
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:16,931
AS PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU HAVE

3235
01:37:17,31 --> 01:37:20,935
USED MILITARY FORCE THERE?

3236
01:37:21,35 --> 01:37:23,971
>> WELL, WHAT WE HAVE TO STOP

3237
01:37:22,736 --> 01:37:25,839
SXTH ABOUT IS THAT WE HAVE

3238
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:28,108
WEAKENED OURSELVES MILITARILY TO

3239
01:37:25,973 --> 01:37:29,810
SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT AFFECTS

3240
01:37:28,242 --> 01:37:33,280
ALL OF OUR MILITARY POLICIES.

3241
01:37:29,944 --> 01:37:34,614
OUR NAVY IS AT ITS SMALLEST SIZE

3242
01:37:33,414 --> 01:37:39,53
SINCE 1917.

3243
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:41,687
OUR AIR FORCE SINCE 1940.

3244
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:43,290
RECENT TELEPHONE, THE COMMANDANT

3245
01:37:41,822 --> 01:37:45,659
OF THE MARINE CORPS SAID HALF

3246
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:47,995
THE UNITS WERE NOT READY.

3247
01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:49,563
AN THE SEQUESTER IS CUTTING THE

3248
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:51,98
HEART OUT OF OUR PERSONNEL.

3249
01:37:49,696 --> 01:37:52,66
OUR GENERALS ARE RETIRING

3250
01:37:51,231 --> 01:37:52,933
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE

3251
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:52,967
PART OF THIS.

3252
01:37:53,67 --> 01:37:57,904
AND AT THE SAME TIME, OUR

3253
01:37:54,601 --> 01:38:00,840
ENEMIES ARE INCREASING.

3254
01:37:58,38 --> 01:38:01,174
OUR FRIENDS CAN'T TRUST US

3255
01:38:00,975 --> 01:38:03,844
ANYMORE.

3256
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:04,144
UKRAINE WAS A NUCLEAR ARMED

3257
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:05,45
STATE.

3258
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:06,380
THEY GAVE AWAY THEIR NUCLEAR

3259
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:07,214
ARMS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING WE

3260
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:08,815
WOULD PROTECT THEM.

3261
01:38:07,348 --> 01:38:09,350
WE WON'T EVEN GIVE THEM

3262
01:38:08,949 --> 01:38:11,451
OFFENSIVE WEAPONS.

3263
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:11,485
WE TURN OUR BACK ON ISRAEL.

3264
01:38:11,585 --> 01:38:15,155
OUR ALLY.

3265
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:17,757
AND IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT, OF

3266
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:18,291
COURSE OBAMA IS NOT GOING TO BE

3267
01:38:17,891 --> 01:38:19,726
ABLE TO DO ANYTHING.

3268
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:20,27
I WOULD SHORE UP OUR MILITARY

3269
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,894
FIRST.

3270
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,364
IF YOU DON'T GET MILITARY RIGHT,

3271
01:38:22,29 --> 01:38:25,466
NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO WORK.

3272
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:25,499
>> GOVERNOR WALKER, AS

3273
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:28,835
PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF

3274
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:31,671
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN

3275
01:38:28,969 --> 01:38:34,774
STARTED A COMPLAIN TO

3276
01:38:31,805 --> 01:38:41,15
DESTABILIZE NATO ALLIES, ESTONE

3277
01:38:34,908 --> 01:38:42,49
I CAN'T, LITHUANIA, MIRRORING

3278
01:38:41,148 --> 01:38:43,984
THE ACTIONS IN UKRAINE.

3279
01:38:42,182 --> 01:38:44,18
>> FIRST, IT IS SAD TO THINK NOW

3280
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:46,786
BUT PROBABLY THE RUSSIAN AND

3281
01:38:45,752 --> 01:38:48,889
CHINESE GOVERNMENT KNOW MORE

3282
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:51,658
ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL

3283
01:38:49,23 --> 01:38:52,759
SERVER THAN DO THE MEMBERS OF

3284
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:54,694
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS.

3285
01:38:52,893 --> 01:38:55,496
AND THAT HAS PUT OUR NATIONAL

3286
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:55,529
SECURITY AT RISK.

3287
01:38:55,629 --> 01:38:58,765
IF I'M PRESIDENT, HE WON'T THINK

3288
01:38:57,464 --> 01:39:01,501
ABOUT THAT.

3289
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:01,535
PUTIN BELIEVES IN THE OLD ADAGE,

3290
01:39:01,635 --> 01:39:05,472
YOU PROBE WITH BAYONETS.

3291
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:07,408
WHEN YOU FIND STEEL YOU STOP.

3292
01:39:05,605 --> 01:39:08,409
UNDER OBAMA AND CLINTON WE FOUND

3293
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:09,643
A LOT OF MUSH.

3294
01:39:08,575 --> 01:39:10,911
WEEED TO HAVE A NATIONAL

3295
01:39:09,776 --> 01:39:13,80
SECURITY THAT PUTS STEEL IN

3296
01:39:11,45 --> 01:39:14,581
FRONT OF OUR END MS.

3297
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:17,884
I WOULD SEND WEAPONS TO UKRAINE.

3298
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:19,719
WORK NATO TO PUT FORCES ON THE

3299
01:39:18,18 --> 01:39:21,821
EASTERN BORDER OF POLE ANDY AND

3300
01:39:19,853 --> 01:39:24,824
THE BALTIC NATIONS AND PUT BACK

3301
01:39:21,955 --> 01:39:28,462
IN PLACE THE MISSILE DEFENSE

3302
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:30,431
SYSTEM THAT WE HAD IN POLAND.

3303
01:39:28,595 --> 01:39:31,432
>> GOVERNOR HUCKABEE, THE CULTER

3304
01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:32,566
OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY IS

3305
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:34,867
DEFINITELY CHANGING.

3306
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:36,503
WOMEN ARE MOVING INTO COMBAT

3307
01:39:35,1 --> 01:39:37,837
ROLES, DON'T ASK DON'T TELL HAS

3308
01:39:36,636 --> 01:39:39,540
BEEN DROPPED.

3309
01:39:37,971 --> 01:39:39,572
NOW DEFENSE SECRETARY ASHTON

3310
01:39:39,673 --> 01:39:43,443
CARTER RECENTLY DIRECTED THE

3311
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:46,179
MILITARY TO PREPARE FOR A MOMENT

3312
01:39:43,577 --> 01:39:48,415
WHEN IT IS WELCOMING TRANSGENDER

3313
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:49,950
PERSONS TO SERVE OPENLY.

3314
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:50,884
AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, HOW WOULD

3315
01:39:50,84 --> 01:39:53,519
YOU HANDLE THAT?

3316
01:39:51,17 --> 01:39:53,920
>> THE MILITARY IS NOT A SOCIAL

3317
01:39:53,653 --> 01:39:55,89
EXPERIMENT.

3318
01:39:54,54 --> 01:39:56,723
THE PURPOSE OF THE MILITARY IS

3319
01:39:55,222 --> 01:39:58,224
KILL PEOPLE AND BREAK THINGS.

3320
01:39:56,856 --> 01:40:00,260
IT IS NOT TO TRANSFORM THE

3321
01:39:58,358 --> 01:40:01,861
CULTURE BY TRYING OUT SOME IDEAS

3322
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:03,363
THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK WOULD

3323
01:40:01,995 --> 01:40:04,331
MAKE US A DIFFERENT COUNTRY AND

3324
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:06,633
MORE DIVERSE.

3325
01:40:04,465 --> 01:40:07,334
THE PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT

3326
01:40:06,766 --> 01:40:10,971
AMERICA.

3327
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:12,139
I'M NOT SURE HOW PAYING FOR

3328
01:40:11,105 --> 01:40:14,141
TRANSGENDER SURGERY FOR

3329
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:15,476
SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN AND

3330
01:40:14,274 --> 01:40:18,878
MARINES MAKES OUR COUNTRY SAFER.

3331
01:40:15,609 --> 01:40:20,414
WE'VE REDUCED THE MILITARY BY

3332
01:40:19,12 --> 01:40:22,682
25% UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA.

3333
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:24,117
THE DISASTER IS THAT WE HAVE

3334
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:24,485
FORGOTTEN WHY WE HAVE A

3335
01:40:24,251 --> 01:40:25,752
MILITARY.

3336
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:26,953
THE PURPOSE OF IT IS TO MAKE

3337
01:40:25,885 --> 01:40:29,256
SURE THAT WE PROTECT EVERY

3338
01:40:27,87 --> 01:40:31,325
AMERICAN WHEREVER THAT AMERICAN

3339
01:40:29,389 --> 01:40:33,327
IS AND IF AMERICA IS CALLING OUT

3340
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:34,827
FOR HELP, IN BENGHAZI OR AT THE

3341
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:35,829
BORDER, THEN WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE

3342
01:40:34,961 --> 01:40:37,764
TO ANSWER IT.

3343
01:40:35,962 --> 01:40:40,700
WE'VE NOT DONE THAT BECAUSE WE

3344
01:40:37,897 --> 01:40:44,671
DECIMATED OUR MILITARY.

3345
01:40:40,834 --> 01:40:45,972
WE'RE FLYING B-52s, THE MOST

3346
01:40:44,804 --> 01:40:46,940
RECENT PUT IN SERVICE WAS

3347
01:40:46,106 --> 01:40:49,409
NOVEMBER OF 1962.

3348
01:40:47,73 --> 01:40:51,878
A LOT OF THEM FLYING, WE'VE ONLY

3349
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:54,80
GOT 44 IN SERVICE, COMBAT READY.

3350
01:40:52,12 --> 01:40:54,348
THE FACT IS MOST ARE OLDER THAN

3351
01:40:54,214 --> 01:41:02,389
ME.

3352
01:40:54,481 --> 01:41:05,90
AND THAT'S PRETTY SCARY.

3353
01:41:02,523 --> 01:41:07,794
>> SENATOR, THE FIRST BUDGET YOU

3354
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:09,263
PROPOSED AT SENATOR CUT ALL

3355
01:41:07,927 --> 01:41:10,397
FINANCIAL AID TO ISRAEL.

3356
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:12,299
YOU HAVE SINCE CHANGED YOUR VIEW

3357
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:13,700
ON THAT ISSUE.

3358
01:41:12,432 --> 01:41:15,235
WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

3359
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:18,172
>> LET'S BE CLEAR, I'M THE ONLY

3360
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:20,473
ONE ON THE STAGE WHO HAS A

3361
01:41:18,305 --> 01:41:22,209
FIVE-YEAR BUDGET THAT BALANCES.

3362
01:41:20,607 --> 01:41:23,977
I'VE PUT PENCIL TO PAYMENT.

3363
01:41:22,342 --> 01:41:25,379
AND I SAID I WOULD CUT SPENDING

3364
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:27,781
AND I'VE SAID EXACTLY WHERE.

3365
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:30,651
EACH OF MY BUDGETS HAS TAKEN A

3366
01:41:27,914 --> 01:41:30,684
MEAT AXE TO FOREIGN AID.

3367
01:41:30,817 --> 01:41:33,920
THINK WE OUGHT TO QUIT SENDING

3368
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:35,355
MONEY TO HATE US.

3369
01:41:34,54 --> 01:41:37,624
I THINK WE OUGHT TO QUIT SENDING

3370
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:38,258
IT TO COUNTRIES THAT BURN OUR

3371
01:41:37,757 --> 01:41:40,626
FLAG.

3372
01:41:38,392 --> 01:41:42,396
ISRAEL ONE OF THOSE.

3373
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:44,764
BUT EVEN BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAID

3374
01:41:42,529 --> 01:41:45,632
THAT ULTIMATELY, THEY WOULD BE

3375
01:41:44,898 --> 01:41:46,32
STRONGER WHEN THEY'RE

3376
01:41:45,765 --> 01:41:47,434
INDEPENDENT.

3377
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:48,868
MY POSITION IS EXACTLY THE SAME.

3378
01:41:47,568 --> 01:41:50,637
WE SHOULDN'T BORROW MONEY FROM

3379
01:41:49,2 --> 01:41:52,406
CHINA TO SEND TO ANYWHERE.

3380
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:54,374
WHY DON'T WE START WITH

3381
01:41:52,539 --> 01:41:55,942
ELIMINATING AID TO OUR ENEMIES.

3382
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:57,143
>> YOU STILL SAY THAT ISRAEL

3383
01:41:56,76 --> 01:41:58,845
COULD BE ONE OF THE COUNTRIES

3384
01:41:57,277 --> 01:42:00,747
THAT IS CUT FROM FINANCIAL AID.

3385
01:41:58,978 --> 01:42:01,715
>> I STILL SAY EXACTLY WHAT MY

3386
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,283
ORIGINAL OPINION IS.

3387
01:42:01,848 --> 01:42:04,518
DO YOU BORROW MONEY FROM CHINA

3388
01:42:03,417 --> 01:42:06,220
TO SEND TO IT ANYONE?

3389
01:42:04,651 --> 01:42:07,221
OUT OF YOUR SURPLUS, YOU CAN

3390
01:42:06,353 --> 01:42:10,156
HELP YOUR ALLIES.

3391
01:42:07,354 --> 01:42:12,726
AND ISRAEL IS A GREAT ALLY AND

3392
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:13,59
THIS IS NO PARTICULAR ANIMUS OF

3393
01:42:12,859 --> 01:42:14,861
ISRAEL.

3394
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:16,496
WHAT I WILL SAY OVER AND OVER

3395
01:42:14,994 --> 01:42:18,732
AGAIN, WE CANNOT GIVE AWAY MONEY

3396
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:20,467
WE DON'T HAVE.

3397
01:42:18,865 --> 01:42:21,300
WE DO NOT PROJECT POWER FROM

3398
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:22,768
BANKRUPTCY COURT.

3399
01:42:21,435 --> 01:42:23,837
WE'RE BORROWING A MILLION

3400
01:42:22,902 --> 01:42:25,505
DOLLARS A MINUTE.

3401
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:26,707
IT HAS TO STOP SOMEWHERE.

3402
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:26,740
>> GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, WHAT DO

3403
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:32,212
YOU THINK OF THAT ANSWER?

3404
01:42:29,409 --> 01:42:32,246
>> LISTEN, IF WE WANT TO DEAL

3405
01:42:32,346 --> 01:42:35,382
WITH THESE ISSUES, WE HAVE TO

3406
01:42:34,147 --> 01:42:36,516
DEAL WITH THEM IN A WAY THAT

3407
01:42:35,515 --> 01:42:38,818
MAKES SENSE.

3408
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:39,152
I AGREE WHAT DR. CARSON SAID

3409
01:42:38,952 --> 01:42:40,654
EARLIER.

3410
01:42:39,286 --> 01:42:41,488
THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS

3411
01:42:40,787 --> 01:42:43,557
STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY.

3412
01:42:41,622 --> 01:42:47,994
I PUT OUT A SPECIFIC PLAN.

3413
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:49,596
NO LESS THAN 500,000 ACTIVE DUTY

3414
01:42:48,128 --> 01:42:51,632
SOLDIERS IN THE ARMY.

3415
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:53,634
BRING US TO A 350 SHIP NAVY

3416
01:42:51,765 --> 01:42:55,335
AGAIN AND MODERNIZE THE OHIO

3417
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:57,671
CLASS OF SUBMARINES, AND BRING

3418
01:42:55,469 --> 01:42:58,872
OUR AIR FORCE BACK TO 2,600

3419
01:42:57,804 --> 01:43:00,741
AIRCRAFT READY TO GO.

3420
01:42:59,5 --> 01:43:00,774
THROWS THE KINDS OF THINGS WILL

3421
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:02,175
SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE AROUND THE

3422
01:43:02,8 --> 01:43:03,242
WORLD.

3423
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:03,277
THROWS THE THINGS WE NEED TO

3424
01:43:03,377 --> 01:43:06,380
WORK ON IMMEDIATELY TO MAKE OUR

3425
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:08,14
COUNTRY STRONGER AND BETTER.

3426
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:09,249
THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE NEED TO

3427
01:43:08,148 --> 01:43:09,283
BE ABLE TO DO.

3428
01:43:09,383 --> 01:43:13,452
AS WE MOVE TOWARD DEALING WITH

3429
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:14,688
FOREIGN AID, I DON'T DISAGREE

3430
01:43:13,587 --> 01:43:16,323
WITH SENATOR PAUL'S POSITION

3431
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:17,324
THAT WE SHOULD NOT FUND OUR

3432
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:18,958
ENEMIES BUT I BELIEVE THAT

3433
01:43:17,457 --> 01:43:20,761
ISRAEL A PRIORITY TO FUND AND

3434
01:43:19,92 --> 01:43:20,794
KEEP THEM STRONG AND SAFE AFTER

3435
01:43:20,894 --> 01:43:23,664
EIGHT YEARS OF THIS

3436
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:26,900
ADMINISTRATION.

3437
01:43:23,797 --> 01:43:28,367
>> GOVERNOR, THANK YOU.

3438
01:43:27,33 --> 01:43:30,69
>> BRET, CAN I JUMP IN?

3439
01:43:28,502 --> 01:43:30,437
>> WE'LL FINISH UP WITH MORE

3440
01:43:30,203 --> 01:43:31,805
QUESTIONS.

3441
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:33,139
>> AFTER THE BREAK, WE'LL LET

3442
01:43:31,938 --> 01:43:36,242
THE CANDIDATES MAKE THEIR

3443
01:43:33,273 --> 01:43:37,778
CLOSING STATEMENTS.

3444
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:37,811
THEIR FINAL THOUGHTS AND GOD.

3445
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:39,179
STAY TUNED FOR THAT.

3446
01:43:52,592 --> 01:43:54,960
>>> WELCOME BACK.

3447
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:55,962
IN OUR FINAL MOMENTS HERE

3448
01:43:55,95 --> 01:43:57,363
TOGETHER WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW

3449
01:43:56,96 --> 01:43:58,63
THE CANDIDATES TO OFFER THEIR

3450
01:43:57,497 --> 01:43:59,766
FINAL THOUGHTS.

3451
01:43:58,197 --> 01:44:04,771
FIRST WE WANT TO ASK THEY WILL

3452
01:43:59,899 --> 01:44:05,772
AN INTERESTING CLOSING QUESTION

3453
01:44:04,904 --> 01:44:07,240
FROM FACEBOOK.

3454
01:44:05,905 --> 01:44:09,575
I WANT TO KNOW IF ANY OF THEM

3455
01:44:07,373 --> 01:44:11,710
HAVE RECEIVED A WORD FROM GOD ON

3456
01:44:09,709 --> 01:44:13,379
WHAT THEY SHOULD DO AND TAKE

3457
01:44:11,845 --> 01:44:14,14
CARE OF FIRST.

3458
01:44:13,513 --> 01:44:15,15
SENATOR CRUZ?

3459
01:44:14,147 --> 01:44:17,316
LET'S START FROM YOU.

3460
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:18,885
ANY WORD FROM GOD?

3461
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:21,87
>> WELL, I AM BLESSED TO RECEIVE

3462
01:44:19,19 --> 01:44:23,123
A WORD FROM GOD EVERY DAY AND

3463
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,156
RECEIVING THE SCRIPTURES AND

3464
01:44:23,256 --> 01:44:25,591
READING THE SCRIPTURES.

3465
01:44:25,58 --> 01:44:27,894
AND GOD SPEAKS THROUGH THE

3466
01:44:25,725 --> 01:44:32,298
BIBLE.

3467
01:44:28,28 --> 01:44:33,266
I'M THEON OF A PASTOR AND AN

3468
01:44:32,431 --> 01:44:34,834
EVANGELIST AND I'VE DESCRIBED

3469
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:36,502
MANY TIME HOW MY FATHER WHEN I

3470
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:37,603
WAS A CHILD WAS AN ALCOHOLIC.

3471
01:44:36,636 --> 01:44:39,939
HE WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN.

3472
01:44:37,737 --> 01:44:41,908
AND MY FATHER LEFT MY MOTHER AND

3473
01:44:40,73 --> 01:44:42,175
LEFT ME WHEN I WAS JUST 3 YEARS

3474
01:44:42,42 --> 01:44:43,910
OLD.

3475
01:44:42,308 --> 01:44:44,678
AND SOMEONE INVITED HIM TO CLAY

3476
01:44:44,44 --> 01:44:46,680
ROAD BAPTIST CHURCH.

3477
01:44:44,811 --> 01:44:47,580
AND HE GAVE HIS HEART TO JESUS

3478
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:48,848
AND IT TURNEDIM AROUND.

3479
01:44:47,714 --> 01:44:52,152
HE GOT ON A PLANE AND HE FLEW

3480
01:44:48,982 --> 01:44:52,185
BACK TO MY MOTHER AND ME.

3481
01:44:52,285 --> 01:44:55,822
I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE

3482
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:57,223
SCRIPTURE TELLS US, YOU SHALL

3483
01:44:55,955 --> 01:44:59,192
KNOW THEM BY THEIR FRUITS.

3484
01:44:57,356 --> 01:44:59,625
WE SEE LOTS OF CAMPAIGN

3485
01:44:59,325 --> 01:45:01,394
CONSERVATIVES.

3486
01:44:59,759 --> 01:45:02,862
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO WIN IN

3487
01:45:01,527 --> 01:45:03,296
2016, WE NEED A CONSISTENT

3488
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:05,98
CONSERVATIVE.

3489
01:45:03,429 --> 01:45:07,667
SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A FISCAL

3490
01:45:05,231 --> 01:45:07,701
CONSERVATIVE, A SOCIAL

3491
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:09,468
CONSERVATIVE, A NATIONAL

3492
01:45:08,534 --> 01:45:10,737
SECURITY CONSERVATIVE.

3493
01:45:09,602 --> 01:45:14,107
THERE ARE REAL DIFFERENCES AMONG

3494
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:15,308
THE CANDIDATES ON ISSUES LIKE

3495
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,943
AMNESTY, OBAMACARE, LIBERTY,

3496
01:45:15,441 --> 01:45:18,878
LIFE, MARRIAGE, AND I HAVE BEEN

3497
01:45:17,77 --> 01:45:20,313
PROUD TO FIGHT AND STAND FOR

3498
01:45:19,12 --> 01:45:22,514
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, TO STAND

3499
01:45:20,446 --> 01:45:24,550
AGAINST PLANNED PARENTHOOD, TO

3500
01:45:22,648 --> 01:45:26,753
DEFEND LIFE FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER

3501
01:45:24,684 --> 01:45:27,453
AND I WILL BE PROUD TO CONTINUE

3502
01:45:26,886 --> 01:45:32,425
TO DO SO AS PRESIDENT OF THE

3503
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:35,195
UNITED STATES.

3504
01:45:32,558 --> 01:45:35,228
>> GOVERNOR KASICH, SAME

3505
01:45:35,328 --> 01:45:38,397
QUESTION.

3506
01:45:35,695 --> 01:45:39,232
>> WELL, MEGYN, MY FATHER WAS A

3507
01:45:38,531 --> 01:45:41,768
MAILMAN.

3508
01:45:39,365 --> 01:45:43,769
HIS FATHER WAS A COAL MINER.

3509
01:45:41,901 --> 01:45:44,104
MY MOTHER COULD BARELY SPEAK

3510
01:45:43,903 --> 01:45:45,872
ENGLISH.

3511
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:47,673
AND THEIR SON STANDS ON THIS

3512
01:45:46,5 --> 01:45:47,974
PODIUM IN THE GREAT STATE OF

3513
01:45:47,807 --> 01:45:49,809
OHIO.

3514
01:45:48,108 --> 01:45:51,577
NOT ONLY AS GOVERNOR BUT A

3515
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:52,178
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE

3516
01:45:51,711 --> 01:45:54,47
UNITED STATES.

3517
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:56,514
I DO BELIEVE IN MIRACLES.

3518
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:56,883
YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD A LOT OF

3519
01:45:56,649 --> 01:45:59,185
ELECTIONS.

3520
01:45:57,16 --> 01:46:00,152
MY ELECTIONS ARE REALLY NOT

3521
01:45:59,318 --> 01:46:02,822
ABOUT CAMPAIGNS.

3522
01:46:00,286 --> 01:46:03,723
I TELL MY PEOPLE THAT THESE ARE

3523
01:46:02,956 --> 01:46:03,757
ABOUT A MOVEMENT.

3524
01:46:03,857 --> 01:46:08,261
AND A MOVEMENT TO DO WHAT?

3525
01:46:05,925 --> 01:46:10,29
TO RESTORE COMMON SENSE.

3526
01:46:08,394 --> 01:46:11,97
A MOVEMENT TO DO THINGS LIKE

3527
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:12,866
PROVIDE CHECK GROWTH.

3528
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:13,867
AND A MOVEMENT NOT TO LET ANYONE

3529
01:46:12,999 --> 01:46:15,534
BE BEHIND.

3530
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,3
TODAY THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED.

3531
01:46:15,668 --> 01:46:19,806
YOU ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE

3532
01:46:17,137 --> 01:46:20,206
POLICE AND THE DIFFICULTY IN

3533
01:46:19,939 --> 01:46:22,375
COMMUNITIES.

3534
01:46:20,339 --> 01:46:22,675
WE'VE GOT TO UNITE OUR COUNTRY

3535
01:46:22,508 --> 01:46:24,277
AGAIN.

3536
01:46:22,809 --> 01:46:25,812
WE'RE STRONGER WHEN WE ARE

3537
01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:26,679
UNITED AND WE ARE WEAKER WHEN WE

3538
01:46:25,945 --> 01:46:28,915
ARE DIVIDED.

3539
01:46:26,813 --> 01:46:30,416
AND WE'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO OTHER

3540
01:46:29,48 --> 01:46:34,19
PEOPLE'S VOICES, RESPECT 87 BUT

3541
01:46:30,549 --> 01:46:35,521
KEEP IN MIND, AND I BELIEVE IN

3542
01:46:34,154 --> 01:46:37,423
MATERIAL OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE

3543
01:46:35,655 --> 01:46:39,159
READ IN MY LIFETIME.

3544
01:46:37,556 --> 01:46:41,393
THE LORD IS NOT PICKING US.

3545
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:43,229
BUT BECAUSE OF HOW WE ALMOST

3546
01:46:41,527 --> 01:46:44,931
HUMAN RIGHTS, BECAUSE WE ARE A

3547
01:46:43,362 --> 01:46:46,166
GOOD FORCE IN THE WORLD, HE

3548
01:46:45,64 --> 01:46:47,700
WANTS AMERICA TO BE STRONG.

3549
01:46:46,299 --> 01:46:50,69
HE WANTS AMERICA TO SUCCEED.

3550
01:46:47,834 --> 01:46:51,637
AND HE WANTS AMERICA TO LEAD.

3551
01:46:50,203 --> 01:46:55,341
AND NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO

3552
01:46:51,771 --> 01:46:56,575
ME THAN MY FAMILY, MY FAITH, AND

3553
01:46:55,474 --> 01:46:59,612
MY FRIENDS.

3554
01:46:56,709 --> 01:46:59,979
>> GOVERNOR WALKER, SAME

3555
01:46:59,745 --> 01:47:02,115
QUESTION.

3556
01:47:00,113 --> 01:47:04,50
>> WELL, THANKS, MEGYN.

3557
01:47:02,248 --> 01:47:06,652
I'M CERTAINLY AN IMPERFECT MAN.

3558
01:47:04,184 --> 01:47:08,87
IT IS ONLY BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS

3559
01:47:06,786 --> 01:47:10,456
CHRIST THAT I'VE BEEN REDEEMED

3560
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:13,826
FROM MY SINS.

3561
01:47:10,589 --> 01:47:15,228
SO GOD HASN'T GIVEN ME A LIST, A

3562
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:16,262
TEN COMMANDMENTS OF THING FOR

3563
01:47:15,361 --> 01:47:17,596
THE FIRST DAY.

3564
01:47:16,395 --> 01:47:19,498
WHAT GOD TELLS US TO DO IS

3565
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:21,000
FOLLOW HIS WILL.

3566
01:47:19,598 --> 01:47:21,534
ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT I WILL

3567
01:47:21,134 --> 01:47:23,769
TRY TO DO.

3568
01:47:21,667 --> 01:47:24,170
I HOME PEOPLE SEE THAT IN MY

3569
01:47:23,903 --> 01:47:27,440
STATE.

3570
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:28,41
WHEN I HAVE 100,000 PROTESTERS

3571
01:47:27,573 --> 01:47:29,608
AT THE CAPITOL.

3572
01:47:28,174 --> 01:47:30,276
IT WASN'T JUST HOW I TOOK ON THE

3573
01:47:29,742 --> 01:47:32,912
POLITICAL BATTLES.

3574
01:47:30,409 --> 01:47:34,280
IT WAS ULTIMATELY HOW I ACTED.

3575
01:47:33,46 --> 01:47:36,582
NOT RESPONDING IN KIND.

3576
01:47:34,413 --> 01:47:39,352
NOT LASHING OUT BUT JUST BEING

3577
01:47:36,716 --> 01:47:42,922
DECENT GOING FORWARD AND LIVING

3578
01:47:39,485 --> 01:47:43,656
MY LIFE THAT WOULD BE A

3579
01:47:43,56 --> 01:47:45,391
TESTIMONY TO MY FAITH.

3580
01:47:43,789 --> 01:47:47,360
>> A WOMAN JUST CAME TO THE

3581
01:47:45,524 --> 01:47:47,727
STAGE AND ASKED, WHAT ABOUT THE

3582
01:47:47,493 --> 01:47:51,464
VETERANS?

3583
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:52,498
I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WHAT

3584
01:47:51,597 --> 01:47:52,866
THESE CANDIDATES WILL DO FOR THE

3585
01:47:52,631 --> 01:47:54,467
VETERANS.

3586
01:47:52,999 --> 01:47:57,3
I PUT THE QUESTION TO YOU ABOUT

3587
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:58,504
GOD AND THE VETERANS, WHICH YOU

3588
01:47:57,136 --> 01:48:00,974
MAY FIND TO BE RELATED.

3589
01:47:58,637 --> 01:48:02,875
>> I THINK GOT HAS BLESSED US.

3590
01:48:01,107 --> 01:48:03,676
HE'S BLESSED THE BOIRT SOME VERY

3591
01:48:03,9 --> 01:48:08,147
GOOD CANDIDATES.

3592
01:48:03,809 --> 01:48:13,719
THE DEMOCRATS CAN'T EVEN FIND

3593
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:15,154
ONE.

3594
01:48:13,853 --> 01:48:15,688
AND I BELIEVE GOD HAS BLESSED

3595
01:48:15,288 --> 01:48:16,289
OUR COUNTRY.

3596
01:48:15,821 --> 01:48:17,223
THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN

3597
01:48:16,422 --> 01:48:18,924
EXTRAORDINARILY BLESSED AND WE

3598
01:48:17,357 --> 01:48:20,726
HAVE HONORED THAT BLESSING.

3599
01:48:19,58 --> 01:48:20,994
AND THAT'S WHY GOD HAS BLESSED

3600
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:22,394
US.

3601
01:48:21,127 --> 01:48:24,864
AND HE'S BLESSED US WITH YOUNG

3602
01:48:22,528 --> 01:48:24,898
MEN AND WOMEN WILLING TO RISK

3603
01:48:24,998 --> 01:48:27,700
THEIR LIVES AND SOMETIMES DIE IN

3604
01:48:26,599 --> 01:48:28,268
UNIFORM FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR

3605
01:48:27,833 --> 01:48:29,302
PEOPLE.

3606
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:30,702
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A V.A.

3607
01:48:29,435 --> 01:48:31,4
THAT DOES NOT DO ENOUGH FOR

3608
01:48:30,836 --> 01:48:32,238
THEM.

3609
01:48:31,137 --> 01:48:32,972
I AM PROUD THAT LAST YEAR WE

3610
01:48:32,372 --> 01:48:34,908
HELPED CHANGE THE LAW.

3611
01:48:33,106 --> 01:48:36,276
WE CHANGE THE LAW TO GIVE THE

3612
01:48:35,41 --> 01:48:37,944
POWER TO THE V.A. SECRETARY, THE

3613
01:48:36,409 --> 01:48:39,577
ABILITY TO FIRE ANY EXECUTIVE

3614
01:48:38,77 --> 01:48:41,47
THAT ISN'T DOING THEIR JOB.

3615
01:48:39,712 --> 01:48:42,748
AND IT IS OUTRAGEOUS, THEY'VE

3616
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:43,582
ONLY FIRED ONE PERSON TO DATE.

3617
01:48:42,882 --> 01:48:44,849
WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

3618
01:48:43,716 --> 01:48:47,186
STATES, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

3619
01:48:44,984 --> 01:48:51,490
V.A. THAT CARES MORE ABOUT OUR

3620
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:54,460
VETERANS THAN VETERANS WHO WORK

3621
01:48:51,624 --> 01:48:57,630
AT THE V.A.

3622
01:48:54,593 --> 01:48:58,831
>> ABOUT GOD AND HIS ROLE, BUT

3623
01:48:57,763 --> 01:49:00,599
ALSO, ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THE

3624
01:48:58,965 --> 01:49:02,435
PUBLIC WAS VERY INTERESTED IN

3625
01:49:00,733 --> 01:49:03,536
AND WE TOUGHED ON IT EARLIER IS

3626
01:49:02,568 --> 01:49:06,72
RACE RELATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.

3627
01:49:03,669 --> 01:49:06,339
AND HOW DIVIDED WE SEEM RIGHT

3628
01:49:06,205 --> 01:49:10,376
NOW.

3629
01:49:06,472 --> 01:49:11,110
WHAT IF ANYTHING YOU CAN DO, YOU

3630
01:49:10,509 --> 01:49:12,979
WOULD DO AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT

3631
01:49:11,244 --> 01:49:15,181
TO HELP HEAL THAT DIVIDE.

3632
01:49:13,112 --> 01:49:16,649
>> I THINK THE BULLY PULPIT IS A

3633
01:49:15,315 --> 01:49:18,317
WONDERFUL PLACE TO START HEALING

3634
01:49:16,782 --> 01:49:22,21
THAT DIVIDE.

3635
01:49:18,451 --> 01:49:23,389
WE HAVE THE PURVEYORS OF HATRED

3636
01:49:22,155 --> 01:49:24,790
WHO TAKE EVERY SINGLE INCIDENT

3637
01:49:23,522 --> 01:49:27,961
BETWEEN PEOPLE OF TWO RACES AND

3638
01:49:24,924 --> 01:49:28,227
TRY TO MAKE A RACE WAR OUT OF

3639
01:49:28,94 --> 01:49:29,329
IT.

3640
01:49:28,361 --> 01:49:31,197
AND DRIVE WEDGES INTO PEOPLE.

3641
01:49:29,462 --> 01:49:31,497
AND THIS DOES NOT NEED TO BE

3642
01:49:31,331 --> 01:49:33,66
DONE.

3643
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:35,268
WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

3644
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:36,768
INSTEAD, I WAS ASKED BY AN NPR

3645
01:49:35,401 --> 01:49:38,637
REPORTER ONCE, WHY DON'T I TALK

3646
01:49:36,902 --> 01:49:41,240
ABOUT RACE THAT OFTEN.

3647
01:49:38,771 --> 01:49:41,574
I SAID BECAUSE I'M A NEURO

3648
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:43,9
SURGEON.

3649
01:49:41,707 --> 01:49:43,376
SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS A STRANGE

3650
01:49:43,142 --> 01:49:44,643
RESPONSE.

3651
01:49:43,509 --> 01:49:46,312
I SAID WHEN I TAKE SOMEONE TO

3652
01:49:44,777 --> 01:49:47,213
THE OPERATING ROOM, I'M

3653
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:48,147
OPERATING ON THE THING THAT

3654
01:49:47,347 --> 01:49:49,581
MAKES THEY WILL WHO THEY ARE.

3655
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:49,949
THE SKIN DOESN'T MAKE THEM WHO

3656
01:49:49,715 --> 01:49:49,983
THEY ARE.

3657
01:49:50,83 --> 01:49:51,517
THE HAIR DOESN'T MAKE THEY WILL

3658
01:49:51,117 --> 01:49:56,255
WHO THEY ARE.

3659
01:49:51,650 --> 01:49:58,624
AND IT IS TIME FOR TO US MOVE

3660
01:49:56,389 --> 01:49:59,25
BEYOND THAT.

3661
01:49:58,757 --> 01:50:02,294
BECAUSE --

3662
01:49:59,158 --> 01:50:04,197
[ APPLAUSE ]

3663
01:50:02,395 --> 01:50:10,436
OUR STRENGTH AS A NATION COMES

3664
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:12,938
IN OUR UNITY.

3665
01:50:10,569 --> 01:50:13,272
WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF

3666
01:50:13,72 --> 01:50:15,708
AMERICA.

3667
01:50:13,406 --> 01:50:16,675
THOSE THAT WANT TO DIVIDE US, WE

3668
01:50:15,841 --> 01:50:18,177
SHOULDN'T LET THEM DO IT.

3669
01:50:16,809 --> 01:50:19,979
>> NOW EACH CANDIDATE WILL MAKE

3670
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:20,13
A CLOSING STATEMENT.

3671
01:50:20,113 --> 01:50:22,748
YOU'LL ALL HAVE 30 SECONDS TO

3672
01:50:21,347 --> 01:50:23,483
MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT F

3673
01:50:22,882 --> 01:50:23,516
THIS DEBATE.

3674
01:50:23,616 --> 01:50:28,687
WE'LL START WITH OHIO GOVERNOR

3675
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:30,523
JOHN KASICH.

3676
01:50:28,821 --> 01:50:31,657
>> YOU KNOW, TONIGHT WE HEAR

3677
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:33,292
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO.

3678
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:33,692
I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT I'VE

3679
01:50:33,426 --> 01:50:35,395
DONE.

3680
01:50:33,826 --> 01:50:37,463
I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED

3681
01:50:35,528 --> 01:50:40,966
SERVICES COMMITTEE FOR 18 YEARS.

3682
01:50:37,596 --> 01:50:41,34
I SPENT A BIG CHUNK OF MY LIFE

3683
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:43,136
STUDYING NATIONAL SECURITY

3684
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,436
ISSUES AND OUR ROLE IN THE

3685
01:50:43,269 --> 01:50:44,370
WORLD.

3686
01:50:43,569 --> 01:50:45,905
NUMBER TWO.

3687
01:50:44,504 --> 01:50:47,140
I WAS THE CHERYL OF THE HOUSE

3688
01:50:46,39 --> 01:50:48,840
BUDGET COMMITTEE.

3689
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:50,143
AND ONE OF THE CHIEF ARCHITECTS.

3690
01:50:48,974 --> 01:50:51,744
THE LAST TIME WE BALANCED A

3691
01:50:50,276 --> 01:50:53,279
BUDGET, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE

3692
01:50:51,877 --> 01:50:54,13
HAD DONE IT SINCE MAN WALKED ON

3693
01:50:53,413 --> 01:50:54,47
THE MOON.

3694
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:57,650
WE HAD A $5 TRILL SURPLUS AND WE

3695
01:50:57,116 --> 01:50:59,785
CUT TAXES.

3696
01:50:57,783 --> 01:51:01,421
I SPENT TEN YEARS IN THE PRIVATE

3697
01:50:59,919 --> 01:51:01,720

01:56:27,413 --> 01:56:30,383
WON.

3883
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:30,649
THEY TRIED TO RECALL ME AND WE

3884
01:56:30,516 --> 01:56:31,817

3885
01:56:30,783 --> 01:56:32,84
THEY TARGETED US AGAIN AND WE

3886
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:34,387
WON.

3887
01:56:32,217 --> 01:56:36,422
WE BALANCED THE BUDGET, CUT

3888
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:38,824
TAXES AND TURN OUR STATE AROUND

3889
01:56:36,555 --> 01:56:40,259
WITH BIG, BOLD REFORM.

3890
01:56:38,957 --> 01:56:42,94
WASN'T TOO LATE FOR WISCONSIN

3891
01:56:40,393 --> 01:56:42,428
AND IT IS NOT TOO LATE FOR

3892
01:56:42,227 --> 01:56:47,700
AMERICA.

3893
01:56:42,561 --> 01:56:49,768
THAT'S WHY I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

3894
01:56:47,833 --> 01:56:51,135
>> GOVERNOR BUSH, CLOSING STATE.

3895
01:56:49,902 --> 01:56:52,371
>> HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE.

3896
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:52,405
I BELIEVE WE'RE AT THE VERGE OF

3897
01:56:52,505 --> 01:56:54,573
THE GREATEST TIME TO BE ALIVE IN

3898
01:56:54,139 --> 01:56:56,241
THIS WORLD.

3899
01:56:54,707 --> 01:56:56,542
BUT WASHINGTON IS HOLDING US

3900
01:56:56,375 --> 01:56:58,778
BACK.

3901
01:56:56,675 --> 01:57:00,513
HOW WE TAX, HOW WE REGULATE,

3902
01:56:58,911 --> 01:57:02,247
WE'RE NOT EMBRANG THE ENERGY

3903
01:57:00,646 --> 01:57:03,482
REVOLUTION IN OUR MIDST.

3904
01:57:02,381 --> 01:57:05,284
A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT

3905
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:06,351
HAS BEEN POLITICIZED RATHER THAN

3906
01:57:05,418 --> 01:57:06,684
TURNING IT INTO AN ECONOMIC

3907
01:57:06,485 --> 01:57:08,53
DRIVER.

3908
01:57:06,819 --> 01:57:09,154
WE'RE NOT PROTECTING AND

3909
01:57:08,186 --> 01:57:13,558
PRESERVING OUR ENTITLEMENT

3910
01:57:09,288 --> 01:57:15,827

HERE'S MY COMMITMENT TYOU.

01:57:20,232 --> 01:57:21,434
I DID IT IN FLORIDA.

01:57:21,534 --> 01:57:24,102
WE CAN FIX THESE THINGS.

3917
01:57:22,468 --> 01:57:25,137
WE CAN GROW ECONOMICALLY AND

3918
01:57:24,236 --> 01:57:26,639

3919
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:28,373

>> OUR COUNTRY IS IN SERIOUS

3928
01:57:41,554 --> 01:57:43,622
TROUBLE.

3929
01:57:41,921 --> 01:57:46,525
WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE.

WE DON'T BEAT CHINA IN TRADE.

WE CAN'T BEAT MEXICO AT THE

01:57:55,67 --> 01:57:58,804
BORDER OR IN TRADE.

3937
01:57:56,869 --> 01:58:02,775
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.

3938
01:57:58,938 --> 01:58:03,208
OUR MILITARY HAS TO BE

3939
01:58:02,908 --> 01:58:04,409
STRENGTHENED.

3940
01:58:03,342 --> 01:58:04,677
